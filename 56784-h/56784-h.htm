<h2><small><small>THE</small></small><br /><br />
PREFACE.</h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">The</span> difference that appears in the several processes of
brewing, though executed with the same materials, by the
same persons, and to the same intent, is generally acknowledged.
The uneasiness this must occasion to those
who are charged with the directive part of the business,
cannot be small: and the more desirous they are of well
executing the duty incumbent on them, the greater is
their disappointment, when frustrated in their hopes. To
remove this uncertainty, no method seems preferable to
that of experiments, as it is by this means alone, any art
whatever can be established upon a solid foundation: but
these require caution, perseverance, and expence; they
must be multiplied and varied both for the same and for
different purposes. The operations of nature elude superficial
enquiries, where we have few or no principles for
our guides, many experiments are made, which tend only
to confound or deceive. Effects seen, without a sufficient
knowledge of their causes, often are neglected, or
viewed in an improper light, seldom faithfully reported,
and, for want of distinguishing the several circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
that attend them, many times become the support of old
prejudices, or the foundation of new ones.</i></p>

<p><i>Whoever is attentive to the practical part of brewing,
will soon be convinced that heat, or fire, is the principal
agent therein, as this element, used in a greater or less
degree, or differently applied, is the occasion of the
greatest part of the variety we perceive. It is but a few
years since the thermometer has been found to be an instrument
sufficiently accurate for any purposes where the
measure of heat is required. And, as it is the only one
with which we are enabled to examine the processes of
brewing, and to account for the difference in the effects,
a theory of the art, founded on practice, must be of
later date than the discovery of the instrument that guides
us to the principles.</i></p>

<p><i>So long since as the year 1741, I began this research,
and never neglected any opportunity to consult the artists
of the trade, or to try such experiments as I conceived
might be conducive to the purpose. It is needless, perhaps
shameful, to mention their number, or to speak of
the many disappointments I met with in this pursuit.
Error admits of numberless combinations. Truth alone
is simple, and confirmed by continuity. At last, flattering
myself with having collected the true theory, assisted
and encouraged by men of abilities, I thought it fit the
public should judge whether I had succeeded in my en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>deavours;
and in 1758 the Essay on Brewing was submitted
to them, either for their approbation, or that the
errors therein might be pointed out. I have had no
reason to repent of my temerity, though perhaps the novelty,
more than the merit of this performance, engaged
the attention, I may add the favor and advice of some
good judges. They have allowed my principles to be at
least plausible, and their agreement with practice has
since repeatedly convinced me they were not far from
truth.</i></p>

<p><i>The Essay just mentioned, revised and corrected, naturally
forms the first part or theory of the present treatise.
The second part is entirely practical. After giving
a short idea of the whole process, I resume its different
branches in as many chapters, and endeavour in such
manner to guide the practitioner, that he may, in every
part, at all times, and under a variety of circumstances,
know what he is to do, and seldom, if ever, to be disappointed
in his object.</i></p>

<p><i>From the investigation of so extensive a business, some
benefit, it is hoped, must accrue to the public; from
the process of brewing being carried on in a just and uniform
manner, our malt liquors, probably, will in time
better deserve the name of wine.</i></p>

<p>Boerhaave, Shaw, Macquer, <i>and most of the great
masters in chymistry are far from limiting that name to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
the liquors produced from the juice of the grape: they
extend it to all fermented vegetable juices, which, on distillation,
yield an ardent spirit, and look on the strength
and faculty wine has to cherish nature, and preserve itself,
to be in proportion to the quantity it possesses of this
liquid, generally termed spirit of wine. This, when thoroughly
pure and dephlegmated, is one and the same,
whatever different vegetable it is produced from. Barley
wines possess the same spiritous principle, which is the
preservative part of the most valuable foreign wines, with
a power of being brewed superior or inferior to them in
quality, and the other constituent parts of beer, beside this
ardent spirit, will not, I believe, be esteemed less wholesome
than those which make up the whole of grape wine.</i></p>

<p><i>The reasons why Great Britain hath not hitherto furnished
foreign nations with this part of her product, but
more especially her seamen, are obvious. Our mariners,
when at home, do not dislike beer, either as to their palates,
or its effects on their constitution; but when abroad,
spiritous liquors, or new wines, often the product of an
enemy’s country, are substituted in lieu thereof. The
disuse of beers, on these occasions, has been owing to the uncertainty
of the principles on which they were brewed; the
maintaining them sound in long voyages and in hot climates,
could not sufficiently be depended upon; and it has
been supposed they could not be procured at so easy a rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
as wines, brandies, or rums, purchased abroad. The
first of these objections, the author hopes, by this work,
to remove; and, were all the duties to be allowed on what
would be brewed for this purpose, our seamen might be
furnished with beer stronger than Spanish wine, and at a
less expence, the mean price of malt and hops being taken
for seven years. It is true that, in times of peace, the
seamen in his Majesty’s service are not very numerous,
but the number of those then employed by merchants is
considerable. I should not have presumed to mention
this, but on account of the encouragement given to the
exportation of corn, and to many manufactures of British
growth or British labor. It is computed that, in England
and Wales, are brewed three millions five hundred
thousand quarters of malt yearly, for which purpose upwards
of one hundred and fifty thousand weight of hops
are used. The improvement of the brewery might become
a means of increasing the consumption of the
growth of our country, viz. of barley, to more than one
hundred thousand quarters, and of hops to between fourteen
and fifteen thousand weight annually.</i></p>

<p><i>Whether this be an object deserving the attention of the
legislative power, or of the landed interest, and what
might be the proper means to put it successfully in practice,
are considerations which do not belong to this place;
it being sufficient here to point out, how universally bene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>ficial
it is to establish the art of brewing on true and invariable
principles.</i></p>

<h2><small><small>AN</small></small><br />

<small>EXPLANATION</small><br />

<small><small><small>OF THE</small></small></small><br />

TECHNICAL TERMS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> intent of every brewer, when he forms his drink,
is to extract the fermentable parts of the malt, in the
most perfect manner; to add hops, in such proportion
as experience teaches him will preserve and ameliorate
the beer; and to employ just so much yeast as is sufficient
to obtain a complete fermentation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said, these particulars are already
sufficiently understood, and that it would be a much
more useful work to publish remedies for the imperfections,
or diseases, beer is naturally or accidentally subject
to, and which at present are deemed incurable. But
if the designs just now mentioned be executed according
to the rules of chymistry, such imperfections and such
diseases not existing, the remedies will not be wanted;
for beer brewed upon true principles, is, neither naturally
nor accidentally, subject to many disorders often
perceived in it. Hence it is evident, that some knowledge
of chymistry is absolutely necessary to complete
the brewer, as, without the informations acquired from
that science, he must be unqualified to lay down rules
for his practice, and to secure to himself the favor of the
public; for which purpose, and to make this treatise useful
to those concerned in the practical part of brewing, it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
been thought adviseable to avoid, as much as possible,
the technical terms of art, to prefix an explanation of
those that necessarily occur, and, in as short a manner as
possible, to trace the properties of fire, air, water, and
earth, as far as they relate to the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acids</span> are all those things which taste sour, as vinegar,
juice of lemons, spirit of nitre, spirit of salt, the oil and
spirit of vitriol, &amp;c. and are put in a violent agitation, by
being mixed with certain earths, or the ashes of vegetables.
An acid enters, more or less, into the composition
of all plants, and is produced by, or rather is the last
effect of, fermentation. Mixed in a due proportion with
an alkali, it constitutes a neutral salt, that is, a salt wherein
neither the acid nor alkali prevail. Acids are frequently
termed acid salts, though generally they appear
under a fluid form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alkalies</span>, or alkaline salts, are of a nature directly
contrary to the acids, and generally manifest themselves
by effervescing therewith: they have an urinous taste,
and are produced from the ashes of vegetables, and by several
other means. They, as well as testaceous and calcarious
substances, are frequently made use of by coopers,
to absorb the acid parts of stale beer, by them called
<i>softning</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Air</span> is a thin elastic fluid, surrounding the globe of the
earth; it is absolutely necessary to the preservation both
of animal and vegetable life, and for the exciting and
carrying on fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcohol</span> is the pure spirit of wine, generally supposed
to be without the least particle of water or phlegm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Animals</span> are organized bodies, endued with sensation
and life. Minerals are said to grow and increase, plants
to grow and live, but animals only to have sensation.&mdash;Animal
substances cannot ferment so as to produce by
themselves a vinous liquor; but there may be cases
wherein some of their parts rather help than retard the
act of fermentation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere</span> is that vast collection of air, with which
the earth is surrounded to a considerable height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attraction</span> is an indefinite term, applicable to all actions
whereby bodies tend towards one another, whether
by virtue of their weight, magnetism, electricity, or any
other power. It is not, therefore, the cause determining
some bodies to approach one another, that is expressed
by the word <i>attraction</i>, but the effect itself. The space,
through which this power extends, is called the <i>sphere
of attraction</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blacking</span> is a technical term used by coopers, to denote
sugar that is calcined, until it obtains the colour that
occasions the name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brewing</span> is the operation of preparing beers and ales
from malt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boiling</span> may thus be accounted for. The minute particles
of fuel being by fire detached from each other,
and becoming themselves fire, pass through the pores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>the vessel, and mix with the fluid. These, being perpetually
in an active state, communicate their motion to
the water: hence arises, at first, a small intestine motion,
and from a continued action in the first cause, the
effect is increased, and the motion of the liquor continually
accelerated; by degrees, it becomes sensibly agitated,
but the particles of the fire, acting chiefly on the particles
that compose the lowest surface of the water, give
them an impulse upwards, by rendering them specifically
lighter, so as to determine them to ascend, according
to the laws of equilibrium. Hence there is a constant
flux of water from the bottom to the top of the vessel,
and reciprocally from the top to the bottom. This appears
to be the reason why water is hot at the top sooner
than at the bottom, and why an equal heat cannot be
distributed through the whole. The thermometer therefore
can be of little service, to determine immediately the
degree of heat, especially in large vessels, on which account
it is better for brewers to heat a certain quantity
just to the act of boiling, and to temper it, by adding a
sufficient quantity of cold water. Boiling water is incapable
of receiving any increase of heat, though acted on
by ever so great a fire, unless the atmosphere becomes
heavier, or the vapours of the water be confined. It occasions
the mercury to rise, according to Farenheit’s
scale, to 212 degrees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charr.</span> A body is said to be charred when, by fire,
its volatile or most active parts are drove out; its coarse
oils, by the same means, placed chiefly on the external
parts; and so deprived of color as to be quite black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleansing</span> is the act of removing the beer from the
ton, where it was first fermented, into the casks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloudy</span> is an epithet joined to such beers, which, from
the violent heat given to the water that brewed them,
are loaded with more oils than can be attenuated by
fermentation, and incorporated with the water; from
whence a muddy and grey oil is seen floating on the surface
of the liquor, though the body is often transparent;
this oil is frequently extracted in such quantity as to exceed
the power of any known menstruum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cohesion</span> is that action by which the particles of the
same body adhere together, as if they were but one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cold</span> is a relative term in opposition to heat. Its
greatest degree is not known, and it is supposed that the
colder a body is, the less is the agitation of its internal
parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colour;</span> a greater or less degree of heat causes different
colours in most bodies, and from a due observation
of the colour of malt, we may determine what degree of
heat it has been impressed with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Density</span> expresses the closeness, compactness, or near
approach of the parts of a body to one another: the more
a body weighs in proportion to its bulk, the greater is
its density. Gold is the densest body in nature, because
there is none known of the same bulk, which weighs so
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Earth</span> is that fossil matter or element, whereof our
globe partly consists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ebullition</span> is the boiling or bubbling of water, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
other liquor, when the fire has forced itself a passage
through it. Brewers suppose water to be just beginning
to boil, when they perceive a small portion of it forced
from the bottom upwards in a right line, so as to disturb
the surface: when the liquor is in this state, they call it
<i>through</i>, or upon the point of ebullition. The vulgar
notion that the water is hotter at this time than when it
boils, is without any foundation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effervescence</span> is a sudden agitation, arising in certain
bodies upon mixing them together; this agitation most
commonly generates heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elasticity</span>, or springiness, is that property of bodies,
by which they restore themselves to their former figure,
after any pressure or distension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Expansion</span> is the swelling or increase of the bulk of
bodies from heat, or any other cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract</span> consists of the parts of a body separated from
the rest, by cold or hot water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fermentation</span> is a sensible internal motion of the particles
of a mixture: by the continuance of this motion,
the particles are gradually removed from their former
situation, and, after some visible separation, joined together
again in a different order and arrangement, so as
to constitute a new compound. No liquors are capable
of inebriating, except those that have been fermented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fixed Bodies</span> are those, which, consisting of grosser
parts, cohering by a strong attraction, and by that means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
less susceptible of agitation, can neither be separated nor
raised, without a strong heat, or perhaps not without
fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fire</span> is only known by its properties, of which the
chief are to penetrate and dilate all solid and fluid
bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Freezing Point</span> is the degree of cold, at which water
begins to be formed into ice, which, according to Farenheit’s
scale, is expressed by 32.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foxed</span> is a technical term, used by brewers, to indicate
beers in a putrid state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gums</span> are concreted vegetable juices, which transude
through the bark of certain trees, and harden upon the
surface; they easily dissolve in water, and by that means
distinguish themselves from balsams or resins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hermetically Sealed</span> is a particular method of stopping
the mouth of vessels, so close that the most subtil
spirit cannot fly out, which is done by heating the neck
of the bottles, till it is just ready to melt, and then with
hot pinchers twisting it close together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Homogeneous</span> is an appellation given to such parts
or subjects, which are similar or of the same nature and
properties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isinglass</span> is a preparation from a fish called huso,
somewhat bigger than the sturgeon; a solution of which
in stale beer is used, to fine or precipitate other beers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
it is imported from Russia by the Dutch, and from them
to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light</span> consists of particles of matter inconceivably
small, capable of exciting in us the sensation of colours,
by being reflected from every point of the surface of
luminous bodies; but, notwithstanding they are so exceeding
small, Sir Isaac Newton found means to divide
a single ray into seven distinct parts, viz. red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malt</span>, in general, is any sort of grain, first germinated,
and then dried, so as to prevent any future vegetation:
that generally used, is made of barley, which
experience has found to be the fittest for the purpose of
brewing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medium</span> is that space, through which a body in motion
passes: air is the medium through which the bodies
near the earth move; water is the medium wherein fish
live; glass affords a medium or a free passage to light.&mdash;This
term is also made use of, to express the mean of
two numbers, and sometimes the middle between several
quantities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musts</span> are the unfermented juices of grapes, or of any
other vegetable substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menstruum</span> is any fluid, which is capable of interposing
its parts between those of other bodies, and in this
manner either dissolves them perfectly, or extracts some
part of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oil</span> is an unctuous, inflammable substance, drawn
from several animal and vegetable substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Precipitation.</span> Isinglass dissolved becomes a glutinous
and heavy body; this put into malt liquors intended
to be fined, carries down, by its weight, all those
swimming particles, which prevent its transparency;
and this act is called fining, or precipitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Repulsion</span>; “Doctor Knight defines it to be that cause
which makes bodies mutually endeavour to recede from
each other, with different forces at different times.” In
this case they are placed beyond the sphere of each
other’s attraction or cohesion, and mutually fly from
each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resins</span>, or balsams, are the oils of vegetables inspissated
and combined with a proportion of the acid salts;
as well as they mix with any spirituous liquor, as little
are they soluble in water; but they become so, either by
the intervention of gums or soaps, or by the attenuating
virtue of fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salts</span> are substances sharp and pungent, which readily
dissolve in water, and from thence, by evaporation,
crystallise and appear in a solid form. They easily
unite together, and form different compounds. Thus
salts, composed of acids and alkalies, partake of both,
and are called neutral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sett</span>: a grist of malt is by brewers said to be sett,
when, instead of separating for extraction, it runs in
clods, increases in heat, and coagulates. This accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
is owing to the over quantity of fire in the water, applied
to any of the extractions. The air included in the
grist, which is a principal agent in resolving the malt,
being thereby expelled, the mass remains inert, and its
parts, adhering too closely together, are with difficulty
separated. Though an immediate application of more
cold water to the grist is the only remedy, yet, as the
cohesion is speedy and strong, it seldom takes effect.&mdash;New
malts, which have not yet lost the heat they received
from the kiln, are most apt to lead the brewer into
this error, and generally in the first part of the process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sugar</span>, or saccharine salts, are properly those that
come from the sugar canes; many plants, fruits and
grains give sweet juices reducible to the same form;
they are supposed to be acids smoothed over with oils;
all vegetable sweets are capable of fermenting spontaneously
when crude; if boiled, they require an addition
of yeast to make them perform that act. Malt, or its
extracts, have all the properties of saccharine salts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur.</span> Though by sulphur is commonly understood
the mineral substance called brimstone, yet in chymistry
it is frequently used to signify in general any oily
substance, inflammable by fire, and, without some saline
addition, indissoluble in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soap or Saponaceous Juices.</span> Common soap is made
of oil mixed with alkaline salts: this mixture causes a
froth on being agitated in water. The oils of vegetables
are, in some degree, mixed with their salts; and according
to the nature of these salts, appear either resinous or
saponaceous, that is, soluble or indissoluble in water.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Sugar is a kind of soap, rendering oil miscible with
water; and therefore all bodies, from which saccharine
salts are extracted, may be termed saponaceous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetable</span> is a term applied to plants, considered as
capable of growth, having vessels and parts for this purpose,
but generally supposed to be without sensation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vinegar</span> is an acid penetrating liquor, prepared from
wine, beer, cyder, or a must, which has been fermented
as far as it was capable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitriol</span> is, in general, a metalline substance combined
with the strongest acid salt known. This acid, being
separated from the metal, differs in nothing from that
which is extracted from alum or brimstone. It is improperly
called spirit of vitriol, when diluted with water,
and, with as little propriety, oil, when free from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Volatile Bodies</span> are those, which, either from their
smallness or their form, do not cohere very strongly together,
and being most susceptible of those agitations,
which keep liquors in a fluid state, are most easily separated
and rarified into vapour, with a gentle heat, and
on the contrary condensed and brought down with cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wine</span> is a brisk, agreeable, spirituous, fluid cordial,
formed from fermented vegetable bodies. In this sense
beers and ales may be called, and really are, barley
wines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worts</span> are the unfermented extracts of malt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yeast</span> is both the flowers and lees of a fermented
wort, the former of these being elastic air enveloped in a
subject less strong and less consistent than the latter.</p>

<big>THEORY OF BREWING.</big></h2>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>SECTION I.<br /><br />

<i>OF FIRE.</i></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>hough</span> fire is the chief cause and principle of almost
every change in bodies, and though persons untaught
in chymistry imagine they understand its nature,
yet, certain it is, few subjects are so incomprehensible,
or elude so much our nicest research. The senses are
very inadequate judges of it; the eye may be deceived,
and suppose no fire in a bar of iron, because it does not
appear red, though at the same time it may contain
enough to generate pain: the touch is equally unfaithful,
for a body, containing numberless particles of heat,
will to us feel cold, if it is much more so than ourselves.</p>

<p>The great and fundamental difference among philosophers,
in respect to the nature of fire, is, whether it be
originally such, formed by the Creator himself, at the
beginning of things; or whether it be mechanically producible
in bodies, by inducing some alteration in the
particles thereof. It is certain that heat may be generated
in a body, by attrition; but whether it existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
there before, or was caused immediately by the motion,
is a matter of no great import to the art of brewing;
for the effects, with which we are alone concerned, are
the same.</p>

<p>Fire expands all bodies, both solid and fluid. If an iron
rod just capable of passing through a ring of the same
metal, is heated red-hot, it will be increased in length,
and so much swelled as not to be able to pass through
the ring, as before:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> if a fluid is put into a bellied glass,
with a long slender neck, and properly marked, the
fluid, by being heated, will manifestly rise to a considerable
height.</p>

<p>The expansion of fluids, by heat, is different in different
fluids; with some exceptions, it may be said to be
in proportion to their density. Pure rain water, gradually
heated to ebullition, is expanded one 26th part of its
bulk,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> so that 27 gallons of boiling water, will, when
cold, measure no more than 26, and 27 gallons of boiling
wort will not yield so much, because worts contain
many oily particles, which, though less dense than wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>ter,
have the property of being more expansible: hence
we see the reason why a copper, containing a given number
of barrels of wort, when cold, is not capable to hold
the same of beer, when boiling.</p>

<p>Bodies are weakened or loosened in their texture by
fire: the hardest, by an increased degree of heat, will
liquify and run; and vegetables are resolved and separated
by it into their constituent parts. It must be owned
vegetables seem at first, on being exposed to the fire, to
become rigid or stiff; but this is owing to the evaporation
of the aqueous particles, which prevented a closer
adhesion of the solid matter. It is only in this manner
fire strengthens some bodies which before were weak.</p>

<p>That the texture of bodies should be loosened by fire,
seems a consequence of expansion; for a body cannot be
expanded but by its particles receding farther from one
another; and if these be not able to regain the situation
they had when cold, the body will remain looser in its
texture than before it suffered the action of fire. This
is the case of barley when malted.</p>

<p>Fire may be conveyed through most bodies, as air, water,
ashes, sand, &amp;c. The effect seems to be different
according to the different conveyances. A difference
appears between boiling and roasting, yet they answer
the same purpose, that of preserving the subject; and
this, in proportion to the degree of heat it has suffered.
A similar variety appears, even to our taste, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
different conveyance of fire to malt: for acids having a
great tendency to unite with water, if this element does
not naturally contain any itself, is the reason why a great
heat is conveyed through water, and applied to extract
the virtues of pale malt; the water gaining from the grain
some of these salts, or possessing them itself, the effect of
this great aqueous heat is not to imprint on the palate a
nauseous burnt taste, as is the case of great heats, when
conveyed through air to the same grain. The salts the
water has obtained, or perhaps had, being sheathed by
the oils it draws from the malt, rather become saccharine,
which cannot be the case when oils are acted upon
by a strong heat, entirely void of any such property;
but malt, the more it is dried, the longer is it capable of
maintaining itself in a sound state, and the liquor brewed
with it will, in proportion to its dryness, keep the longer
sound, the hotter the water is, applied to malt, provided
its heat doth not exceed the highest extracted degree,
the more durable and sound will the extract be.</p>

<p>The last consideration of fire or heat, relative to brewing,
is the knowledge of its different degrees, and how
to regulate them. Till of late, chymists and all others,
were much to seek in this respect; they distinguished
more or less fire in a very vague and indeterminate manner,
as the first, second, third, and fourth degree of heat,
meaning no precise heat, or heat measured by any standard;
but, by the invention of the thermometer, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
are enabled to regulate our fires with the utmost precision.
Thermometers are formed on different scales; and
therefore, when any degree of heat is mentioned, in order
to avoid confusion, the scale made use of should be indicated.
I have constantly employed Fahrenheit’s, as it is
the most perfect, and the most generally received. According
to this instrument,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> by the author of it, an
artificial cold was made so as the mercury stood at 72
divisions below the first frost. The gentlemen of the French
Academy, in the winter of the year 1736, observed, at
Torneao, Latitude 65° 51´, the natural cold to be 33 degrees
below 0: these are proofs there are colds much
more intense than the first frost, or 32 degrees, where
water first begins to harden into ice; from 32 to 90 degrees
are the limits of vegetation, according to the different
plants that receive those or the intermediate heats.
The 40th degree is marked by Boerhaave as the first fermentable
heat, and the 80th as the last: 47 degrees I
have found to be generally the medium heat of London,
throughout the year, in the shade; 98 degrees is said to
be that of our bodies when in health, as from 105 to 112
are its degrees when in a fever. Hay stacked with too
much moisture, when turned quite black, in the heart of
the rick, indicated a heat of 165 degrees. At 175 the
purest and highest-rectified spirits of wine boil, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>this degree I have found well-grown malts to charr, at
212 degrees water boils, at 600 quicksilver and oil of vitriol.
Gold, silver, iron, and most other metals in fusion
exceed this heat; greater still than any known is
the fire in the focus of the burning lens of Tschirnhausen,
or of the concave mirror made by Villette; they are
said to volatilise metals and vitrify bricks. Thus far experiments
have reached; but how much more, or how
much less, the power of this element extends, will probably
be forever hid from mankind.</p>

<small><i>OF AIR.</i></small></h3></div>

<p><big><span class="smcap">None</span></big> of the operations, either of nature or art, can
be carried on without the action or assistance of air. It
is a principal agent in fermentation; and therefore brewers
ought to be well acquainted with its principal properties
and powers.</p>

<p>By air we mean a fluid, scarcely perceptible to our
senses, and discovering itself only by the resistance it
makes to bodies. We find it every where incumbent
on the surface of the globe, rising to a considerable
height, and commonly known by the name of atmosphere.
The weight of air is to that of water as 1 to
850, and its gravitating force equal to that of a column
of water of 33 feet high; so that an area of one foot
square receives, from air, a pressure equal to 2080 pounds
weight.</p>

<p>Elasticity is a property belonging only to this element,
and this quality varies in proportion to the compressing
weights. We scarcely find this element, (any more than
the others) in a pure state; one thousandth part of common
air, says Boerhaave, consists of aqueous, spiritous,
oily, saline, and other particles scattered through it.&mdash;These
are not, or but little, compressible, and in general
prevent fermentation: consequently, where the air is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
purest, fermentation is best carried on. The same author
suspects, that the ultimate particles of air cohere together,
so as not easily to insinuate themselves into the
smallest pores, either of solids or fluids. Hence, those
acquainted with brewing, easily account, why very hot
water, which forces strong and pinguious particles from
malt, forms at the same time extracts unfavourable for
fermentation, as oils are an obstruction to the free entrance
of air; and, from an analogous reason, extracts
which are much less impressed with fire, in them fermentation
is so much accelerated, that the whole soon becomes
sour.</p>

<p>Air, like other bodies, is expanded and rarified by
heat, and exerts its elasticity in proportion to the number
of degrees of fire it has received; the hotter therefore
the season is, the more active and violent will the fermentation
be.</p>

<p>Air abounds with water, and is perpetually penetrating
and insinuating itself into every thing capable of receiving
it. Its weight, or gravitating force, must necessarily
produce numberless effects. The water contained
in the air is rendered more active by its motion; hence
the saline, gummous, and saponaceous particles it meets
with are loosened in their texture, and, in some degree,
dissolved. As principles similar to these are the chief
constituent parts of malt, the reason is obvious why
such, which are old, or have lain a proper time exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
to the influence of the air, dissolve more readily, or, in
other words, yield a more copious extract than others.</p>

<p>All bodies in a passive state, remaining a sufficient
time in the same place, become of the same degree of
heat with the air itself. On this account the water,
lying in the backs used by brewers, is nearly of the
same degree of heat as the thermometer shews the open
air in the shade to be. When this instrument indicates
a cold below the freezing point, or 32 degrees, if the
water does not then become ice, the reason is, because it
has not been exposed long enough to be thoroughly affected
by such a cold. For water does not immediately
assume the same degree of temperature with the air,
principally on account of its density, also from its being
pumped out of deep and hot wells, from its being kept
in motion, and from many other incidents. Under these
circumstances, no great error can arise to estimate its
heat equal to 35 degrees.</p>

<p>Air is not easily expelled from bodies, either solid or
fluid. Water requires two hours boiling to be discharged
of the greatest part of its air. That it may be
thus expelled by heat appears from hence; water, if
boiled the space abovementioned, instead of having any
air bubbles when it is froze, as ice commonly has, becomes
a solid mass like crystal.</p>

<p>Worts or musts, as they contain great quantities of
salts and oils, require a greater degree of heat to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
them boil: consequently more air is expelled from boiling
worts, than from boiling water in the same time;
and as air doth not instantaneously re-enter those bodies,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
when cold, they would never ferment of themselves.
Were it not for the substitute of yeast, to supply
the deficiency of air lost by boiling, they would fox
or putrify, for want of that internal elastic air, which is
absolutely necessary to fermentation.</p>

<p>As air joined to water contributes so powerfully to
render that fluid more active, that water which has endured
fire the least time, provided it be hot enough, will
make the strongest extracts.</p>

<p>Though there is air in every fluid, it differs in quantity
in different fluids; so that no rule can be laid down
for the quantity of air, which worts should contain.&mdash;Probably
the quantity, sufficient to saturate one sort, will
not be an adequate proportion for another.</p>

<p>Air in this manner encompasses, is in contact with,
confines, and compresses all bodies. It insinuates itself
into their penetrable passages, exerts all its power either
on solids, or fluids, and finding in bodies some elements
to which it has a tendency, unites with them. By its
weight and perpetual motion, it strongly agitates those
parts of the bodies in which it is contained, rubs, and
intermixes them intimately together. By disuniting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>some, and joining others, it produces very singular effects,
not easily accomplished by any other means.&mdash;That
this element has such surprising powers, is evident
from the following experiment. “Fermentable parts
duly prepared and disposed in the vacuum of Mr.
Boyle’s air-pump will not ferment, though acted upon
by a proper heat; but, discharging their air, remain
unchanged.”</p>

<small><i>OF WATER.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> water is perpetually an object of our senses, and made
use of for most of the purposes of life, it might be imagined
the nature of this element was perfectly understood: but
they who have enquired into it with the greatest care,
find it very difficult to form a just idea of it. One reason
of this difficulty is, water is not easily separated from
other bodies, or other bodies from water. Hartshorn,
after having been long dried, resists a file more than
iron; yet, on distillation, yields much water. I have
already observed, that air is intimately mixed with, and
possibly never entirely separated from it, but in a <i>vacuum</i>;
how is it possible then ever to obtain water perfectly
pure?</p>

<p>In its most perfect state, we understand it to be a liquor
very fluid, inodorous, insipid, pellucid, and colourless,
which, in a certain degree of cold, freezes into a
brittle, hard, glassy ice.</p>

<p>Lightness is reckoned a perfection in water, that which
weighs less being in general the purest. Hence the
great difficulty of determining the standard weight it
should have. Fountain, river, or well waters, by their
admixture with saline, earthy, sulphureous, and vitriolic
substances, are rendered much heavier than in their na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>tural
state; on the other hand, an increase of heat, or an
addition of air, by varying the expansion, diminishes the
weight of water. A pint of rain-water, supposed to be
the purest, is said to weigh 15 ounces, 1 drachm, and 50
grains, but, for the reasons just now mentioned, this must
differ in proportion as the seasons of the year do from
each other.</p>

<p>Another property of water, which it has in common
with other liquors, is its fluidity, which is so great, that a
very small degree of heat, above the freezing point,
makes it evaporate. Experiments to ascertain the proportion
steamed away of the quantity of water used in
brewing, is an object worthy of the artist’s curiosity;
but the purer the water is, the more readily it evaporates.
Sea-water, which is supposed to contain one fortieth
part of salt, more forcibly resists the power of fire,
and wastes much less, than that which is pure.</p>

<p>The ultimate particles of this element, Boerhaave believed
to be much less than those of air, as water passes
through the pores and interstices of wood, which never
transmit the least elastic air; nor is there, says he, any
known fluid, (fire excepted, which forces itself through
every subject) whose parts are more penetrating than
those of water. Yet as water is not an universal dissolver,
there are vessels which will contain it, though
they will let pass even the thick syrup of sugar, for su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>gar
makes its way by dissolving the tenacious and oily
substance of the wood, which water cannot do.</p>

<p>Water, when fully saturated by fire, is said to boil,
and by the impulse of that element, comes under a strong
ebullition. Just before this violent agitation takes
place, I have already observed, it occupies one seventy-sixth
more space than when cold: so the brewer who
would be exact, when he intends to reduce his liquor to
a certain degree of heat, must allow for this expansion,
abating therefrom the quantity of steam exhaled.</p>

<p>As water, by boiling, may be said to be filled or saturated
with fire, so may it be with any other substance
capable of being dissolved therein; but, though it will
dissolve only a given quantity of any particular substance,
it may, at the same time, take in a certain proportion of
some other. Four ounces of pure rain water will melt
but one ounce of common salt, and after taking this as
the utmost of its quantity, it will still receive two scruples
of another kind of salt, viz. nitre. In like manner
the strongest extract of malt is capable of receiving the
properties belonging to hops: but in a limited proportion.
This appears from the thin bitter pelicle, that
often swims on the surface of the first wort of brown
beers, which commonly are overcharged with hops, by
putting the whole quantity of them at first therein; the
wort not being capable of suspending all that the heat
dissolves, it no sooner cools but these parts rise on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
top. This may serve as a hint to prevent this error, by
suffering the first wort to have no more hops boiled
therein than it can sustain: but as this incident must vary,
in proportion to the heat of the extracts and quantity
of water used, some few experiments are necessary to indicate
the due proportion for the several sorts of drink.
This however should always be extended to the utmost,
for the first wort, which, from its nature and constituent
parts, stands most in need of the preservative quality the
hops impart.</p>

<p>Water acts very differently, as a menstruum, according
to the quantity of fire it contains: consequently its
heat is a point of the utmost importance with regard to
brewing, and should be properly varied according to
the dryness and nature of the malt, according as it is
applied either in the first or last mashes, and in proportion
also to the time the beer is intended to be kept.
These ends, we hope to shew, are to be obtained to a
degree of numerical certitude.</p>

<p>Nutrition cannot be carried on without water, though
likely water itself is not the matter of nourishment, but
only the vehicle.</p>

<p>Water is as necessary to fermentation as heat or air.
The farmer, who stacks his hay or corn before it is sufficiently
dried, soon experiences the terrible effects of
too much moisture, or water, residing therein: all vegetables
therefore intended to be long kept, ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
well dried. The brewer should carefully avoid purchasing
hops that are slack bagged, or kept in a moist place,
or malt that has been sprinkled with water soon after it
was taken from the kiln. By means of the moisture, an
internal agitation is raised in the corn, which agitation,
though soon stopped, for want of a sufficient quantity of
air, yet, the heat thereby generated remaining, every
adventitious seed, fallen from the air, and resting on the
corn, begins to grow, and forms a moss, which dies, and
leaves a putrid musty taste behind, always prevailing,
more or less, in beer made from such grain.</p>

<p>That water is by no means an universal solvent, as
some people have believed, has been already observed.
It certainly does not act as such on metals, gems, stones,
and many other substances: it is not in itself capable of
dissolving oils, but is miscible with highly rectified spirits
of wine, or alchohol, which is the purest vegetable
oil in nature. All saponaceous bodies, whether artificial
or natural, fixed or volatile, readily melt therein; and
as many parts of the malt are dissoluble in it, they must
either be, or become by heat, of the nature of soap,
that is, equally miscible with oils and water.</p>

<p>When a saponaceous substance is dissolved in water,
it lathers, froths, and bears a head; hence, in extracts of
malt, we find these signs in the underback. Weak and
slack liquors, which contain the salts of the malt without
a sufficient quantity of the oils, yield no froth. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>what
like this happens, when the water for the extract
is over-heated, for then as more oils are extracted than
are sufficient to balance the salts, the extract comes
down as before, with little or no froth or head. This
sameness of appearance, from two causes directly opposite
to each other, has many times misled the artist, and
shews the necessity there is to employ means less liable
to error.</p>

<p>This might be a proper place to observe the difference
between rain, spring, river, and pond waters; but
as the art of brewing is very little affected by the difference
of waters, if they be equally soft, but rather depends
on the due regulation of heat; and as soft waters
are found in most places, and become more alike, when
heated to the degree necessary to form extracts from
malt; it is evident, that any sort of beer or ale may be
brewed with equal success, where malt and hops can be
procured proper for the respective purposes. If hitherto
prejudice and interest have appropriated to some
places a reputation for particular sort of drinks, it has
arose from hence; the principles of the art being totally
unknown, the event depended on experience only, and
lucky combinations were more frequent where the
greatest practice was. Thus, for want of knowing the
true reason of the different properties observed in the
several drinks, the cause of their excellencies or defects
was ignorantly attributed to the water made use of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the inhabitants of particular places soon found an advantage,
in availing themselves of this local reputation.
But just and true principles, followed by as just a practice,
must render the art more universal, and add dignity
to the profession, by establishing the merit of our barley
wines on knowledge, not on opinion void of judgment.
To place this truth in a fuller light, and to communicate
to the brewer the readiest means to examine any waters
he may have occasion to use, I have extracted from
Doctor Lucas’s Essay on Waters, the experiments he
made on the Thames, New River, and Hampstead company’s
waters, but without closely adhering to the accuracy
this gentleman prescribed to himself; such exactness
much better suiting a man of his abilities: for the
purposes of brewing it is not of absolute necessity.</p>

<small><i>OF EARTH.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Regularity</span> requires some notice should be taken
of this element. The great writer on chymistry, so often
mentioned, defines it to be a simple, hard, friable, fossil
body, fixed in the fire, but not melting in it, nor dissoluble
in water, air, alcohol, or oil. These are the characters
of pure earth, which, no more than any of the
other elements, comes within our reach, free from admixture.
Though it is one of the component parts of
all vegetables, yet as, designedly, it is never made use of
in brewing, except sometimes for the purpose of precipitation;
it is unnecessary to say any thing more upon it:
whoever desires to be farther informed concerning its
properties may consult all, or any of the authors before

<h3 class="nobreak">SECTION V.<br /><br />

<small><i>OF MENSTRUUMS OR DISSOLVENTS.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> menstruums is understood a body which, in a fluid
or subtilised state, is capable of interposing its small
parts betwixt the small parts of other bodies. This act
so obviously relates to the art of brewing, especially
where the extracting of the malt and the boiling of the
hops are concerned, that it should not be passed unheeded
by.</p>

<p>The doctrine of menstruums, as laid down by Boerhaave,
seems most intelligible and applicable to our purpose.
He says, the solutions of bodies in general are the
effect only of attraction and repulsion, between the particles
of the menstruums and those of the body dissolved,
the whole action depending on the relation between
these two; of consequence, there cannot be any body,
natural or artificial, which, without distinction, will dissolve
all bodies whatsoever; nor is the cause assignable
why certain menstruums dissolve certain bodies: the
effects of alcaline, acid, neutral, fixed, or volatile salts,
any more than those of oils, water, alcohol, fire, or air,
are not to be accounted for by any general rule, that
universally holds true; nor even, in many cases, doth the
dissolution of a body depend on the purity or simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of the menstruum: the nearest path then to success, is
cautiously to apply every menstruum we know of to
the body whose solvent we want to discover.</p>

<p>The elements of fire and air greatly promote the action
and effect of menstruums, and in this light they are admitted
as such. Water dissolves most salts, all the natural
sapos of plants, and the ripe juices of fruits; for in
these, the oils, salts, and spirit of the vegetables, are accurately
mixed and concreted together, and malts, having
the same constituent parts with them, this element
becomes a proper menstruum to extract this grain:
though malts, by being dried with heats which greatly
exceed what is necessary to bring barley to a state of maturity,
do, from hence, require greater, though determinate
heats, yet inferior to that at which water boils;
but such heats must be applied in proportion to their
dryness, to extract their necessary parts. Even earths,
by the intervention of acids, dissolve in water; but having
treated of the four elements already, as far as we conceived
was requisite for the art of brewing, we shall, in
this chapter, confine ourselves to oils and salts, and view
these acting as menstruums only.</p>

<p>To the definition already given of oils, it may be necessary
to add, in general, they contain some water, and
a volatile acid salt; that they receive different appellations,
and have different properties in proportion to their
respective spissitudes. Oils from vegetables are obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>ed
by expression, infusion, and distillation; in either of
which methods, a too great heat is to be avoided, as this
gives them a prejudicial rancidness, and where water
does not interpose, alters their color until thereby they
are turned black.</p>

<p>In general oils unite with themselves, but, excepting
alcohol, not with water, unless when combined with
salts, for salts attract water, and so they do oils: hence
arises many elegant preparations both natural and artificial,
from which wines are formed.</p>

<p>The power of oils in dissolving bodies is in a proportion
to their heat, and being capable, when pure, of receiving
a quantity of fire equal to 600 degrees, it is not
surprising this liquid should mix with gums and with resinous
bodies; but the color of these, and of every subject
when thrown into boiling oils, changes in proportion
to the impression made on them by heat, either to a yellow,
a red, or a black. Oils which are inspissated, or
thickened by heat, are termed balsams. Do not the oils
of malt, from the heat they have undergone, resemble
these? and from the circumstance of their having endured
a heat superior to that necessary for putrefaction,
may they not be suspected to possess a volatile alcaline
salt? Beyond doubt, the extracts from malt (though they
boil at a heat of 218 degrees only) yet do they, in great
measure, dissolve hops, which are gum resinous.</p>

<p>Salt may well be denominated a menstruum, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
easily diluted with water; fixed alcaline salts we have
already seen appear to be the produce of fire alone.&mdash;Such
are never distinguished in the composition of vegetables
in their natural state; though a volatile alcalious
salt (the effect of heat equal or superior to that necessary
for putrefaction) is found in many, and especially in
such as are putrified.</p>

<p>The power of a fixed alcali as a solvent is great, applied
(says Boerhaave) to animal, vegetable, or fossil
concretions, so far as they are oils, balsams, gummy, resinous,
or of gummy resinous nature, and therefore concreted
from oily substances: these, this salt intimately
opens, attenuates, and resolves: disposing them to be
perfectly miscible with water: oils of alcohol leaving
however the impression of taste naturally belonging
to this salt.</p>

<p>Vegetable acid salt dissolves animal, vegetable, fossil,
and metalline substances, except mercury, silver, and
gold. In most terrestrial vegetables this salt is evident;
ripe mealy corn has the least indication of it, yet extracts
therefrom, when fermented, and sometimes before they
are fermented, discover sensibly their acidity. Sea-plants
in general have not their roots inserted in the earth at
the bottom of the sea, and these in distillation yield an
oily volatile alcali; but more subtil than the native acids
of vegetables, are the vinous acids produced by fermentation;
they dissolve equally most matters put into them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and render the whole homogene. Into a must or wort,
when under this act, by means of an elæosaccharum,
might be introduced the choicest flavors, and the aromatics
of the Indies be applied to heighten the taste and
flavor of our barley wines. The laws of England at
present subsisting are indeed opposite to any improvement
of this sort, from the apprehensions of abuse: but
where elegance alone is intended, undoubtedly the merit
of our beers and ales might thereby be increased. As
such, this is a part of chymical knowledge well worth the
enquiry and attention of the brewer.</p>

<p>Neutral salts have already been mentioned; these are
very various, and very different when acting as menstruums.
Resins and gum-resins are generally said to
be most effectually dissolved by alcohol; but Boerhaave
informs us, that sal-amoniac (a very salutary subject and
a neutral salt) if boiled with gums, resins, or the gum-resins
of vegetables, intimately resolves, and disposes
them to be conveniently mixed in aqueous and fermenting
spiritous menstruums. Of this class of salts thus
much is sufficient. This observation perhaps is of too
much consequence to escape the notice of the artist.</p>

<small><i>OF THE THERMOMETER.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> instrument is designed for measuring the increase
or decrease of heat. By doing it numerically, it fixes in
our minds the quantity of fire, which any subject, at any
time, is impregnated with. If different bodies are
brought together, though each possesses a different degree
of heat, it teaches us to discover what degree of
heat they will arrive at when thoroughly mixed, supposing
effervescence to produce no alteration in the mixture.</p>

<p>The inventor of this admirable instrument is not certainly
known, though the merit of the discovery has been
ascribed to several great men, of different nations, in order
to do them and their countries honor. It came to
us from Italy, about the beginning of the sixteenth century.
The first inventors were far from bringing this
instrument to its present degree of perfection. As it
was not then hermetically sealed, the contained fluid
was, at the same time, influenced by the weight of the
air, and by the expansion of heat. The academy of
Florence added this improvement to their thermometers,
which soon made them more generally received; but,
as the highest degree of heat of the instrument, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>structed
by the Florentine gentlemen, was fixed by the
action of the strongest rays of the sun in their country,
this vague determination, varying in almost every place,
and the want of a fixed universal scale, rendered all the
observations made with such thermometers of little use
to us.</p>

<p>Boyle, Halley, Newton, and several other great men,
thought this instrument highly worthy of their attention.
They endeavoured to fix two invariable points to reckon
from, and, by means of these, to establish a proper division.
Monsieur des Amontons is said to have first made
use of the degree of boiling water, for graduating his
mercurial thermometers. Fahrenheit, indeed, found the
pressure of the air, in its greatest latitude, would cause
a variation of six degrees in that point; he therefore concluded,
a thermometer made at the time when the air
is in its middle state, might be sufficiently exact for
almost every purpose. Long before the heat of boiling
water was settled as a permanent degree, many means
were proposed to determine another. The degree of
temperature in a deep cave or cellar, where no external
air could reach, was imagined by many a proper one;
but what that degree truly was, and whether it was fixed
and universal, was found too difficult to be determined.
At last the freezing point of water was thought of, and
though some doubts arose, with Dr. Halley and others,
whether water constantly froze at the same degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
cold, Dr. Martine has since, by several experiments,
proved this to be beyond all doubt, and this degree is
now received for as fixed a point as that of boiling
water.</p>

<p>These two degrees being thus determined, the next
business was the division of the intermediate space on
some scale, that could be generally received. Though
there seemed to be no difficulty in this, philosophers of
different countries have not been uniform in their determinations,
and that which is used in the thermometer at
present the most common, and, in other respects, the
most perfect, is far from being the simplest.</p>

<p>The liquid wherewith thermometers were to be
filled, became the object of another enquiry. Sir Isaac
Newton employed, for this purpose, linseed oil; but
this, being an unctuous body, is apt to adhere to the sides
of the glass, and, when suddenly affected by cold, for
want of the parts which thus stick to the sides, does not
shew the true degree.</p>

<p>Tinged water was employed by others; but this freezing,
when Fahrenheit’s thermometer points 32 degrees,
and boiling, when it rises to 212, was, from thence, incapable
of denoting any more intense cold or heat.</p>

<p>Spirit of wine, which endures much cold without
stagnating, was next made use of; but this liquor,
being susceptible of no greater degree of heat than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
which, in Fahrenheit’s scale, is expressed by 175, could
be of no service where boiling water was concerned.</p>

<p>At last the properest fluid, to answer every purpose,
was found to be mercury. This had never been known
to freeze<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>; and not to boil under a heat of 600 degrees,
and is free from every inconveniency attending other
liquors.</p>

<p>As the instrument is entirely founded on this principle,
that heat or fire expands all bodies, as cold condenses
them, there was a necessity of employing a fluid
easy to be dilated. A quantity of it is seated in one part
in the bulb. This being expanded by heat, is pushed
forward into a fine tube, or capillary cylinder, so small,
that the motion of the fluid in it is speedy and perceptible.
Some thermometers have been constructed with
their reservoir composed of a larger cylinder; but in general,
at present, they are made globular. The smaller
the bulb is, the sooner it is heated through, and the finer
the tube, the greater will be the length of it, and the
more distinct the degrees. It is scarcely possible that
any glass cylinder, so very small, should be perfectly
regular; the quicksilver, during the expansion, passing
through some parts of the tube wider than others, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>degrees will be shorter in the first case, and longer in the
latter. If the divisions, therefore, are made equal between
the boiling and freezing points, a thermometer,
whose cylinder is irregular, cannot be true. To rectify
this inconveniency, the ingenious Mr. Bird, of London,
puts into the tube about the length of an inch of mercury;
and measuring, with a pair of compasses, the true
extent of this body of quicksilver in one place, he moves
it from one end to the other, carefully observing where
it increases or diminishes in length, thereby ascertaining
the parts, and how much the degrees are to be varied.
By this contrivance, his thermometers are perfectly accurate,
and exceed all that were ever made before.</p>

<p>I shall not trouble my reader with numerous calculations
that have been made, to express the quantity of
particles of the liquor contained in the bulb, in order to
determine how much it is dilated. This, Dr. Martine seems
to think a more curious than useful enquiry. It is sufficient,
for our purpose, to know how the best thermometers
ought to be constructed: they who have leisure and
inclination, may be agreeably entertained by the author
last cited.</p>

<p>By observing the rise of the mercury in the thermometer,
during any given time, as, for instance, during
the time of the day, we ascertain the degree and value
of the heat of every part of the day, from whence may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
be fixed the medium of the whole time, or any part
thereof. By repeated experiments, it appears, the medium
heat of most days is usually indicated at eight
o’clock in the morning, if the instrument is placed in
the shade, in a northern situation, and out of the reach
of any accidental heat.</p>

<p>Though water is not so readily affected as air by heat
and cold, yet, as all bodies long exposed in the same
place, become of the same degree of heat with the air
itself, no great error can arise from estimating water, in
general, to be of the same heat as the air, at eight o’clock
in the morning, in the shade.</p>

<p>The thermometer teaches us that the heat of boiling
water is equal to 212 degrees, and by calculation we may
know what quantity of cold water is necessary to bring
it to any degree we choose; so, notwithstanding the instrument
cannot be used in large vessels, where the water
is heating, yet, by the power of numbers, the heat
may be ascertained with the greatest accuracy. The
rule is this: multiply 212, the heat of boiling water, by
the number of barrels of water thus heated, (suppose 22)
and the number of barrels of cold water to be added to
the former, (suppose 10,) by the heat of the air at eight
o’clock, (suppose 50,) add these two products together,
and divide by the sum of the barrels; the quotient shews
the degree of heat of the water mixed together.</p>

<p>We shall meet hereafter with some incidents, which occasion
a difference in the calculations made for the purpose
of brewing, but of these particular mention will be
made in the practical part.</p>

<p>The thermometer, by shewing the different degrees of
heat of each part of the year, informs us, at the same
time, how necessary it is the proportions of boiling water
to cold should be varied to effect an uniform intent; also
that the heat of the extracts of small beer should differ
proportionably as the heats of the seasons do: it assists us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
to fix the quantity of hops necessary to be used at different
times; how much yeast is requisite, in each term of
the year, to carry on a due fermentation; and what variation
is to be made in the length of time that worts
ought to boil. Indeed, without this knowledge, beers,
though brewed in their due season, cannot be regularly
fermented, and whenever they prove good, so often may
it be said fortune was on the brewer’s side.</p>

<p>Beers are deposited in cellars, to prevent their being
affected by the variations of heat and cold in the external
air. By means of the thermometer, may be determined
the heat of these cellars, the temper the liquor is
kept in, and whether it will sooner or later come forward.</p>

<p>The brewing season, and the reason why such season
is fittest for brewing, can only be discovered by this instrument.
It points out likewise our chance for success,
when necessity obliges us to brew in the summer months.</p>

<p>As all vegetable fermentation is carried on in heats,
between two settled points, we are, by this instrument,
taught to put our worts together at such a temperature,
as they shall neither be evaporated by too great a heat,
nor retarded by too much cold.</p>

<p>If curiosity should lead us so far, we might likewise
determine, by it, the particular strength of each wort, or
of every mash; for if water boils at 212 degrees, oil at
600, and worts be a composition of water, oil and salt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the more the heat of a boiling wort exceeds that of
boiling water, the more oils and salts must it contain, or
the stronger is the wort.</p>

<p>A given quantity of hops, boiled in a given quantity
of water, must have a similar effect, consequently the
intrinsic value of this vegetable may, in the same manner,
be ascertained.</p>

<p>The more the malts are dried, the more do they alter
in color, from a white to a light yellow, next to an amber,
farther on to a brown, until the color becomes
speckled with black; in which state we frequently see it.
If more fire or heat is continued, the grain will at last
charr, and become intirely black. By observing the
degrees of heat necessary to induce these alterations, we
may, by the mere inspection of the malt, know with
what degree of fire it has been dried; and fixing upon
such which best suits our purpose, direct, with the
greatest accuracy, not only the heat of the first mash,
but the mean heat the whole brewing should be impressed
with to answer our intent, circumstances of the
greatest consequence to the right management of the
process.</p>

<p>If I had not already said enough to convince the brewer
of the utility of this instrument, how curious he ought
to be in the choice, and how well acquainted with the
use of it, I should add the heat gained by the effervescing
of malt, is to be determined by it alone; the quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>tity
of heat lost by mashing, by the water in its passage
from the copper to the mash ton, and by the extract
coming down into the underback, these can be found by
no other method; and, above all, that there is no other
means to know with certainty the heat of every extract.</p>

<p>I know very well good beers were sometimes, perhaps
often, made before the thermometer was known, and
still is, by many who are entirely ignorant of it; but this,
if not wholly the effect of chance, cannot be said to be
very distant from it. They who carry on this process,
unassisted by principles and the use of the thermometer,
must admit they are frequently unsuccessful, whereas
did they carefully and with knowledge apply this instrument,
they certainly would not be disappointed.&mdash;It
is equally true, the brewing art, for a long space of
time, has been governed by an ill-conveyed tradition
alone; if lucky combinations have sometimes flattered
the best practitioners, faulty drinks have as often made
them feel the want of certain and well established rules.
It is just as absurd for a brewer to refuse the use of the
thermometer, as it would be for an architect to reject
the informations of his plummet and rule, and to assert
they were unserviceable because the first house, and probably
many others, were built without their assistance.</p>

<small>OF THE VINE, ITS FRUITS, AND JUICES.</small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> these short accounts of the principles and instrument
necessary to the right understanding of the
brewing art, we should now draw near to the particular
object of this treatise, but as the most successful method
to investigate it, must be first to inspect the great and
similar example nature has set before us, our time will
not be lost by making this enquiry.</p>

<p>Any fermented liquor, that, in distillation, yields an inflammable
spirit miscible with water, may be called
wine, whatever vegetable matter it is produced from.&mdash;As
beer and ales contain a spirit exactly answerable to
this definition, brewing may justly be called the art of
making wines from corn. Those, indeed, which are the
produce of the grape, have a particular claim to the
name, either because they are the most ancient and the
most universal, or that a great part of their previous
preparation is owing to the care of nature itself. By
observing the agents she employs, and the circumstances
under which she acts, we shall find ourselves enabled to
follow her steps, and to imitate her operations.</p>

<p>Most grapes contain juices, which, when fermented,
become in time as light and pellucid as water, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
possessed of fine spiritous parts, sufficient to cherish,
comfort, and even inebriate. But these properties of
vinosity are observed not to be equally perfect in the
fruits of all vines; some of them are found less, others
not at all proper for this purpose. It is therefore necessary
to examine the circumstances which attend the
forming and ripening of those grapes, whose juices produce
the finest liquors of the kind.</p>

<p>All grapes, when they first bud forth, are austere and
sour, therefore of a middle nature. And this can be no
other than the effect of the autumnal remaining sap,
mixed with the new raised vernal one, the consequence
of which mixture will be found greatly to merit our inquiry.
As far as our senses can judge, at first, it appears
that the juice, in this state, consists of somewhat more
than an acid combined with a tasteless water. When
the fruit is ripe, it becomes full of a rich, sweet, and
highly flavoured juice. The color, consistency, and
taste of which shew, that, by the power of heat, a considerable
quantity of oil has been raised, and, sheathing
the salts, is the reason of its saccharine taste and saccharine
properties.</p>

<p>In England, grapes are probably produced under the
least heat they can be raised by. They discover themselves
in their first shape, about June, when the medium
heat of the twenty-four hour’s shade is 57,60. This,
with what more should be added for the effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
sun’s beams, are the degrees of heat which first introduce
the juices into this fruit.</p>

<p>The highest degrees of heat, in the countries where
grapes come to perfect maturity, have been observed to
be, in various parts of Italy, Spain, and Greece 100, and
at Montpelier 88, in the shade; to which, according to
Dr. Lining’s observations, 20 degrees must be added
for the effect of the sun’s beams. The greatest heat in
Italy will then amount to 120 degrees, and in the south
of France to 108. These approach nearly to the
strongest heats observed in the hottest climates, which,
in Astracan, Syria, Senegal, and Carolina, were from 124
to 126 degrees.</p>

<p>Those countries, where the heat is greatest, in general
produce the richest fruits, that is, the most impregnated
with sweet, thick and oily juices. We are told, among the
Tockay wine-hills, there is one which, directly fronting
the south, and being the most exposed to the sun, yields
the sweetest and richest grapes. It is called the <i>sugar-hill</i>,
and the delicious wines extracted from this particular
spot, are all deposited in the cellars of the imperial
family. Those grapes, some in the Canaries, some
in other places, being suffered to remain the longest on
the tree, with their stems half cut through, by this means
procure their juices to be highly concentrated, and produce
that species of sweet, oily, balmy wines, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
from this operation, are called <i>sack</i>, a derivation of the
French word <i>sec</i> or <i>dry</i>.</p>

<p>In all distillations of unfermented vegetables, water
and acid salts rise first. A more considerable degree of
fire is required for the elevation of oils, and a still greater
one for the lixivial salts, which render those oils miscible
with water.</p>

<p>A plant, exposed to a very gentle heat, at first yields a
water which contains the perfect smell of the vegetable
blended with a subtile oil; if more heat be added, an
heavier oil will come over: from some a volatile alkali,
from others a phlegm will rise, which gradually grows
acid; and, last of all, with the farther assistance of fire,
the black, thick, empyreumatic sulphur. Nature, in
a less degree, may be said to place a like series of events
before our eyes, in the forming and maturating of
grapes, and it is by imitating what she does, that the inhabitants
of different countries may improve the advantages
of their soil and of their air.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the doctrine, that grapes are endued
with various properties, in proportion to the heat
of the air they have been exposed to, let us remember
what Boerhaave has observed, that, in very hot weather,
the oleous corpuscles of the earth are carried up
into the air, and, descending again, cause the showers
and dews in summer to be very different from the pure
snow of winter. The first are acrid, and disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
froth, the last is transparent and insipid. Hence summer
rain, or rain falling in hot seasons, is always fruitful,
whereas in cold weather it is scarcely so at all. In winter
the air abounds with acid parts, neither smoothed by
oils nor rarified by heat: cold is the condensing power, as
heat is the opener of nature. In summer, the air, dilating
itself, penetrates every where, and gives to the rain
a disposition to froth, occasioned by the admixture of
oleous and aërial particles. Thus the acid salts, either
previously existing, or by the vernal heat introduced into
the grapes, and necessary to their preservation, are neutralized
by coming in contact with the juices the foregoing
autumn produced; after which a hotter sun, covering
or blending these juices with oils, changes the whole
into a saccharine form. In proportion as these acids are
more or less sharp, and counterbalanced by a greater or
lesser quantity of oils, the juices of grapes approach
more or less to the state of perfection, which fermentation
requires.</p>

<p>There are many places, as Jamaica, Barbadoes, &amp;c.
in which experience shews the vine cannot be cultivated
to advantage. By comparing the heat of these places
with those in Italy and Montpelier, it appears this defect
is not owing to excessive heats, but to their constancy
and uniformity; the temperature of the air of these
countries seldom being so low as the degree necessary
for the first production of the fruit. Whenever the cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>tivation
of the vine is attempted in these parts of the
West Indies, the grapes, on their first appearance, are
shaded and skreened from the beams of the sun, which,
in their infancy, they are not able to bear.</p>

<p>Hence we learn, though nature employs both the autumnal
and vernal seasons, yet there are lesser heats with
which she prepares the first juice of grapes, a stronger power
of the sun she requires to form the fruit, and a greater
than either to ripen it. We have investigated the lowest
degrees of heat, in which grapes are produced, and nearly
the highest they ever receive to ripen them. Let us
call the first the <i>germinating</i> degrees, and the last those
of <i>maturation</i>. If nearly 58 be the lowest of the one,
and 126 the highest of the other, and if a certain power
of acids is necessary for the germination of the grapes,
which must be counterbalanced by an equal power of
oils raised by the heat of the sun for their maturation,
then the medium of these two numbers, or 92, maybe
said to be a degree at which this fruit cannot possibly
be produced, and inferior to that by which it should be
maturated. At Panama the lowest degree of heat in the
shade is 72, to which 20 being added, for the sun’s
beams, the sum will be 92, and consequently no grapes
can grow there, except the vines be placed in the
shade.</p>

<p>If we recollect that we can scarcely make wine, which
will preserve itself, of grapes produced in England, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
shall be induced to think, that the reason of this defect
is the want of the high degrees of heat. Our sun seldom
raises the thermometer to 100 degrees, and that but
for a short continuance. Our medium heat is far inferior
to 92, and hence we see, at several distant terms in
summer, new germinated grapes, but seldom any perfectly
ripe. These observations, the use of which, in
brewing, we will endeavour to apply, likewise point out
to us, what part of our plantations are fit to produce this
fruit, and to what degree of perfection.</p>

<p>A research made for each constituent part forming
grapes, as well as the proportion they bear to one another,
at first sight, appears to be an eligible method to
discover the nature of wines; but in every vegetable
their parts are mixed and interwoven, and every degree
of heat, acting on them, finds these so blended, as to
render their division too imperfect for such enquiry to
be made with sufficient accuracy, to deduce therefrom
the rules of an art. In the producing, ripening, and
fermenting the juice of the grapes, as well as in forming
beers and ales, the element of fire so superlatively influences
and governs every progressive act, as to occasion
some remarkable difference in their appearance: from,
hence, then, we may expect the information we want,
and be enabled to discover the laws by which Nature
forms her wines.</p>

<p>When the constituent parts of a subject are to be esti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>mated
by heat alone, the number of degrees comprehended
between the first heat which formed it, and the
last which brought it to a perfect state, must express
the whole of its constituent parts. Complete finished
substances, must have been benefited by the whole latitude
of degrees applicable thereto; and in proportion as
part of the whole latitude is wanting, will their nature
be different, and themselves less perfect.</p>

<p>This variety is remarkable in the fruit we are now
treating of. A country endued with the lowest germinating,
and with the highest maturating degrees of heat
for grapes, would produce them in the utmost perfection;
that is, they would possess all the several properties
they could obtain from this circumstance; consequently
such are capable of forming wines that
would preserve themselves a very long time, and would
also become spontaneously fine. From the several
heats we have observed that this fruit is capable of enduring,
it is reasonable to believe the greatest number of
degrees of heat employed to form all their constituent
parts, must be where, during the whole space of vegetation,
the heat in the shade varies from 60 to 106 degrees,
and constitutes a difference of 46 degrees. So
great a latitude, ordered by nature, most certainly denotes
the general utility of the plant.</p>

<p>The climate of the southern part of France approaches
nearest to this; but Spanish wines are richer; their grapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
are formed by a warmer sun; their vernal and maturating
heats exceed those of France; but, at the same time,
their wines are more stubborn, and, to be made fine, require
the help of precipitation. This variety increases
according to the heat of climates: thus we see wines
which come from the coast of Africa, whose richness and
stubbornness are beyond the reach of any menstruum
employed to fine them. Let us endeavour to reduce this
apparent inconstancy to rule, in order to assist our art.&mdash;If
the lowest heat which forms the grape, in the southern
parts of France, be 60 degrees, and if 88 degrees, in the
shade, be the mean of their maturating heat, the difference
between 60 and 88, or 28 degrees, is the number
which includes the constituent parts of grapes in this
country, as these degrees imply the whole space of their
progress. If like juices were to be imitated by art, as
in our hot-houses, it is clear half the number of the degrees
of heat which form the whole of the constituent
parts, or 14, deducted from 74, the mean heat of their
whole vegetation, would give 60, for the first heat to be
employed, and this to be raised, for maturation, to 88, the
greatest heat, nature in this case, permits, or 14 degrees
to be added to the same whole mean. To liken the
wines of Spain, where the autumnal and vernal heats are
greater than in France, the heat forming the first juices
must be more, as also the maturating heats; but with
such practice, the number of constituent degrees would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
be found to be fewer, and spontaneous brightness could
no more be expected, than it is found, in their wines.</p>

<p>A strict enquiry after the heats first and last applied
to grapes, is of such consequence to ascertain the principles
by which malt liquor should be formed, that,
though grapes produced in England scarcely make wines
which can maintain themselves sound, yet, as the rule
is universal, even from them we shall be able to establish
not only its certainty, but also the application of
the number of the degrees found between the heats which
germinate the fruit, and those which ripen them.</p>

<p>If, from their medium, 59.35, we subtract 1.75, half
their difference, or half their constituent parts, we must
have left 57.60 for the germinating heat; and if to their
medium, 59.35, we add 1.75, half the number of their
constituent parts, we shall have 61.10, the highest mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
heat, in the shade, at the time the richest juices of our
grapes are formed. It is true, in July, nor even in the
following months, when the heat continues nearly alike,
our grapes are not ripe, nor gathered; the properties
raised by our greatest sunshine, as yet have not reached
the fruit, and though the mean heat of the air in September
and October is less, yet it is sufficient to place in
the grapes the juices raised by the preceding hot sun,
which concentrate and grow richer, by remaining on the
plant, though, for want of a sufficient heat, they do not
reach that perfection obtained in warmer climates.</p>

<p>The want of grapes in many parts both of America
and Africa, and the reason we gave for this, (See page
55,) warrants the truth of the division we have just now
made, between the germinating and maturating heats;
and if the effects caused by a hot sun do not immediately
benefit the fruit, by a parity of reason, after the grapes
are gathered, the plant must possess, (and surely for
some longer space, by a continued heat, equal, and often
superior, to the vernal sun,) juices which Nature
is too frugal not usefully to apply; these juices, we apprehend,
assist in forming the embryo of the leaves
which are fully to expand the ensuing year, and serve,
by their oleaginous quality, to preserve these and the
whole plant during the cold of the winter; which cold,
at the same time that it contracts the pores of the vine,
condenses and thickens these richer juices, from whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
few, if any of them, are lost or expended by perspiration.
The heat of the following spring renews their activity,
when blending with those this season attracts, the
leaves open, the flowers appear, and the fruit forms.
Thus far we conceive the act of germination extends,
provided for and assisted both by the autumnal and vernal
heats, and which, in point of power, are nearly equal
and uniform.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun, during summer months, and if to
this we add the more constant heat at the roots of the vine,
retained there by the density of the earth; these (though
superior to the germinating heat) produce a like uniformity
for maturating the fruit: thus nature, in order
to implant in wines an original even taste, and to facilitate
the fermentable act, amidst the great variety that
appears to us in the heat of the air, seems, upon the
whole, to act by steady and equal motions; or rather,
perhaps, this is the best manner by which we can reduce
to rule; the inconstancy of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I am sensible these facts had been represented in a
more natural light, had I observed the degrees of heat
impressed on the vine in every season of the year;
the difference of the sun’s heat, in every hour of the day,
a variety exceeding that in the shade; that between
night and day; the aspect of the plant; the heat of the
earth at its surface, as well as at the roots of the vine;
all these would have increased the circumstances to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
prodigious extent; which, though perhaps requisite to
satisfy philosophic investigation, might, from their
number and variety, have been the means rather to induce
us to error, than to discover the general rules by
which nature acts.</p>

<p>From the above-related process we are taught, that nature,
in forming wines, is not confined to a certain
fixed number of degrees, but admits, for this act, of
a considerable latitude, according to the extent of
which the wines vary in taste and properties; and that
she affects an equality of heat in each period of vegetation;
from whence the brewer is taught, if he form his
malt-liquors with four mashes, as in the autumn and
spring the vine is impressed with heats nearly uniform,
so ought his two first mashes to be; the third, in imitation
of the high heat of summer, should be much hotter, and
the heat of his last mash the same with this; and this
general rule has been found universally true, for beers
expected to preserve themselves sound a sufficient time;
and admits but of a proportional variation, when fewer
or more mashes are employed, as the degrees of heat
denominating the constituent parts of the grain, must be
applied in proportion to the quantity of water used to
each mash; but in malt liquors speedily to be drank, or
when we deviate greatly from the more perfect productions
of nature, we are then compelled to swerve from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
her rules; a practice never profitable, and which nothing
but necessity can justify.</p>

<p>The nature of the soil proper for the vine, might, in
another work, be a very useful enquiry. It will be sufficient
here, barely to hint at the effect, which lixivial
soils produce in musts. The Portugueze, when they
discovered the Island of Madeira in 1420, set fire to the
forests, with which it was totally covered. It continued
to burn for the space of seven years, after which the
land was found extremely fruitful, and yielding such
wines, as, at present, we have from thence, though in
greater plenty. It is very difficult to fine these wines,
and, though the climate of this island is more temperate
than that of the Canaries, the wines are obliged to be
carried to the Indies and the warmer parts of the globe,
to be purged, shook, and attenuated, before they can
arrive to an equal degree of fineness with other wines;
were the Portugueze acquainted with what may be termed
the artificial method of exciting periodical fermentation,
much or the whole of this trouble might be avoided.
Hence we see, that soils impregnated with alkaline salts
will produce musts able to support themselves longer,
and to resist acidity more, than other soils, under the same
degree of heat.</p>

<p>Grapes have the same constituent parts as other vegetables.
The difference between them, as to their tastes
and properties, consists in the parts being mixed in dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>ferent
proportions. This arises, either from their absorbent
vessels more readily attracting some juices than
others, or from their preparing them otherwise, under
different heats and in different soils.</p>

<p>We find, says Dr. Hales, by the chymical analysis of
vegetables, that their substance is composed of sulphur,
volatile salts, water, and earth, which principles are endued
with mutual attracting powers. There enters likewise
in the composition, a large portion of air, which has
a wonderful property of attracting in a fixed, or of repelling
in an elastic state, with a power superior to vast
compressing forces. It is by the infinite combinations,
actions, and reactions of these principles, that all the operations
in animal and vegetable bodies are effected.&mdash;Boerhaave,
who is somewhat more particular with regard
to the constituent parts of vegetables, says, that they
contain an oil mixed with a salt in form of a sapo, and
that a saponaceous juice arises from the mixture of water
with the former.</p>

<p>Thus we see, from the composition of grapes, that
they have all the necessary principles to form a most exquisite
liquor, capable, by a gentle heat, to be greatly
attenuated. They abound with elastic air, water, oils,
acid, and neutral salts, and even saponaceous juices.&mdash;The
air contained in the interstices of fluids is more in
quantity than is commonly apprehended. Sir Isaac Newton
has proved that water has forty times more pores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
than solid parts; and the proportion, likely, is not very
different in vegetable juices. When the fruit is in its
natural entire state, the viscidity of the juices, and their
being enveloped by an outward skin, prevent the expansion
of the inclosed air; it lies as it were inactive. In
this forced state, it causes no visible motion, nor are the
principles, thus confined, either subjected to any apparent
impressions of the external atmosphere, or so intimately
blended as when they are expressed. A free
communication of the external air, with that contained
in the interstices of the liquor, is required to form a perfect
mixture. By what means this is effected, what alterations
it produces, or, in general, in what manner the
juice of the grape becomes wines, must be the subject of
our next inquiry.</p>

<p>The process of a perfect fermentation is undoubtedly
the same (where the due proportions of the constituent
parts, forming the must, are exactly kept) whatever vegetable
juices it is excited in. For this reason, we will
observe the progress of this act in beers and ales, these
being subjects we are more accustomed to, and where the
characters appear more distinct, in order to apply what
may be learned from thence to our chief object, the business
of the brewer.</p>

SECTION VIII.<br /><br />

<small><i>OF FERMENTATION IN GENERAL.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Vegetable</span> fermentation is that act, by which oils
and earth, naturally tenacious, by the interposition of
salts and heats, are so much attenuated and divided, as to
be made miscible with, and to be suspended in, an homogeneous
pellucid fluid; which, by a due proportion of
the different principles, is preserved from precipitation
and evaporation. According to Boerhaave, a less heat
than forty degrees leaves the mass in an inert state, and
the particles fall to the bottom in proportion to their gravity;
a greater heat than eighty degrees disperses them
too much, and leaves the residuum a rancid, acrimonious,
putrid mass.</p>

<p>It is certainly very difficult, if not impossible, to discover
the true and adequate cause of fermentation. But,
by tracing its several stages, circumstances, and effects,
we may perhaps perceive the agents and means employed
by nature to produce this singular change; a degree
of knowledge, which, we hope, is sufficient to answer
our practical purposes.</p>

<p>The must, when just pressed from the grapes, is a liquid,
composed of neutral and lixivial salts, oils of different
spissitude, water, earth, and elastic air. These, ir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>regularly
ranged, if I may be permitted the expression,
compose a chaos of wine. Soon after the liquor is
settled, a number of air bubbles arise, and at first adhere
to the sides of the containing vessel; their magnitude increases
as they augment in number, so that at last they
cover the whole surface of the must.</p>

<p>It has been long suspected, and, if I mistake not, demonstrated,
that an acid, of which all others are but so
many different species, is universally dispersed through,
and continually circulating in, the air; and that this is
one of nature’s principal agents, in maturating and resolving
of bodies. Musts, like other bodies, being porous,
the circulating acids very powerfully introduce themselves
therein by the pressure of the atmosphere, in proportion
as the pores are more or less expanded by the
heat they are exposed to. The particles of acids are
supposed by Newton to be endued with a great attractive
force, in which their activity consists. By this force,
they rush towards other bodies, put the fluid in motion,
excite heat, and violently separate some particles in such
manner as to generate or expel air, and consequently
bubbles.</p>

<p>From hence it appears that, as soon as the acid particles
of the air are admitted into the must, they act on
the oils, and excite a motion somewhat like the effervescence
generated, when acids and oils come in contact,
though in a less degree. This motion is the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
heat, by which the included elastic air, being rarefied,
occasions the bubbles to ascend towards the surface.&mdash;These,
by the power of attraction, are drawn to the
sides of the vessel; at first they are small and few, but increase,
both in number and magnitude, as the effect of
the air continues, till, at last, they spread over the whole
surface. The first stage of vegetable fermentation shews
itself to be a motion excited by the acids floating in the
air, acting on the oleous parts of the liquor, which motion
gives an opportunity to the divided minute parts of
air, dispersed throughout the whole, to collect themselves
in masses: from hence they become capable to exert their
elasticity, and to free themselves from the must. (See
Arbuthnot on air p. 116.) It may, perhaps, be proper
to observe, that all musts, which ferment spontaneously,
contain for this purpose a large portion of elastic air.</p>

<p>Bubbles still continue to rise after the must is entirely
covered with them;  and a body of bladders is formed,
called, by the brewers, the <i>head of the drink</i>; as the bubbles
increase, the head rises in height, but the oils of the
must, being as yet of different spissitudes, those which are
least tenacious soon emit their air; others, somewhat
stronger, being rarefied by the fermenting heat, rise on
the surface higher than the rest, while such aerial bubbles
as are more dense, take their place below them.
From hence, and from the constituent parts of the drink
not being as yet intimately mixed, the head takes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
uneven and irregular shape, and appears like a beautiful
piece of rock work. After this, it requires some time,
and it is by degrees, that the particles dispose themselves
in their due order, to be farther attenuated by the act of
fermentation, which, when effected, the saline, oily, and
spiritous parts become perfectly miscible with the
water. The head of the liquor then is more level; heterogeneous
bodies, as dirt, straw, corks, &amp;c. assisted by
bubbles of air adhering to them, are now buoyed on the
surface, and should be skimmed off, lest, when the liquor
becomes more light and spiritous, they should subside.
About this time, such parts of the must as are too
course to be absorbed in the wine (as they consist
chiefly of pinguious oils, mixed with earth, though they
strongly envelope much elastic air) from their weight,
sink to the bottom, and form the lees. But the internal
motion increasing, the air bubbles grow larger; some, not
formed of parts so strong as the others, which generally
are the first, burst and strengthen the rest; and thereby
a heat is retained in the fermenting liquor, which carries
the act on to a farther degree. The particles of the must
become more pungent and spiritous, because more fine
and more active; some of the most volatile ones fly off;
hence, that subtle and dangerous vapor, called <i>gas</i>,
which extinguishes flame and suffocates animals. The
wine, by these repeated acts, being greatly attenuated,
is at last unable to support, on its surface, the weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
such a quantity of froth, rendered more dense by the
repeated explosions of the air bubbles. Now, lest the
liquor should be fouled by the falling in of the froth, it is
put in vessels having only a small aperture, where it
continues to ferment, with a slower and less perceptible
motion, which gradually diminishing until it reaches the
period when it neither attracts or repels air, it admits of
its communication with it to be cut off; not that thereby,
in a strict sense, the fermentation can be said to be completely
ended: the least heat is sufficient to renew, or rather
to continue the act, more especially if by any means the
atmosphere can gain any admittance, however small.</p>

<p>The alteration caused in the liquor, by the pressure
of the external air, from the very first of its fermenting,
not only occasions the particles of the must to form
themselves in their due order, but also, by the weight and
action of that element, grinds and reduces them into
smaller parts. From hence they more intimately blend
with each other, the wine becomes of an equal and even
taste, and if the constituent parts of the must be in a perfect
proportion, it will continue to ferment, until, these
being disposed and ranged in right lines, a fine and pellucid
fluid is produced.</p>

<p>That this operation subsists, even after the liquor becomes
fine, is evident; for every fretting is a continuance
of fermentation, though often almost imperceptible.
Thus, the component parts of the liquor are continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
reduced to a less volume, the oils become more attenuated,
and less capable of retaining elastic air. As these frettings
are often repeated, it is impossible to determine, by
any rule, the exact state in which wine should be, in
order to be perfect for use. It would seem, however,
that the more minutely the parts are reduced, the more
their pungency will appear, and the easier their passage
be in the human frame. Both wines and beers, when
new, possess more elastic air, than when meliorated by
age; to be wholesome, they must be possessed of the
whole of the fermentable principles. For these reasons,
beers and ales, when substituted for wines in common,
and more especially when given to the sick, should always
be brewed from entire malt: for the last extracts,
possessing but the inferior virtues of the grain, have by
so much less the power to become light, spiritous, and
transparent.</p>

<p>Wines never totally remain inactive; fermentation in
some degree continues, and in time the oils, by being
greatly attenuated, volatilise, fly off, and permit a readier
admission of the external air into the drink. In proportion
as this circumstance takes place, the latent acids of
the liquor shew themselves, the wine becomes sour, and
in this state is termed vinegar.</p>

<p>Its last stage or termination is, when the remaining
active principles, which the vinegar possessed, being evaporated
in the air, a pellicle forms itself on the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of the liquor, and dust and seeds, which always float
in the atmosphere, depositing themselves thereon,
strengthen this film into a crust, on which grows moss,
and many other small plants. These vegetables, together
with the air, exhaust the watery parts; after which
no signs of fermentable principles remain but, like
the rest of created beings, all their virtues being lost,
what is left is a substance resembling common earth.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, then, it appears, that a liquor fit for
fermentation must be composed of water, acids smoothed
over with oils, or saccharine salts, and a certain portion
of elastic air; the heat of the air the liquor is fermented
in, must be in proportion to the density of its oils; and
lastly, that the pores are to be expanded by slow degrees,
lest the air, by being admitted too hastily, should cause
an effervescence rather than a fermentation, and occasion
the whole to become sour. Wines, therefore, fermented
in countries where the autumn is hot, require
their oils to be more pinguious, than where the season
is cooler. For the same reason beers are best made,
when the air is at forty degrees of heat, or below the
first fermentable point, because the brewer, in this case,
can put his wort to work, at a heat of his own chusing,
which will not be increased by that of the air; on the
contrary, when, by its internal motion, the heat becomes
greater, it will again be abated and regulated by the cold
of the medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>The pores of a wort are expanded in proportion to the
heat it is impressed with; on which account common
small beer, brewed in summer, when the air and acids
more easily insinuate themselves into the liquor, ought
to be enriched with oils obtained by hotter extracts, to
sheath these salts; and in winter the contrary method
must be pursued.</p>

<p>From this history of fermentation, we can, with propriety,
account for the many accidents and varieties that accompany
this act; and a comparative review of some of
them may not be unnecessary.</p>

<p>A cold air, closing the pores of the liquor, always retards,
and sometimes stops, fermentation; heat, on the
contrary, constantly forwards this act; but, if carried
too high, immediately prevents it.</p>

<p>A must, loaded with oils, will ferment with more difficulty
than one which abounds with acids; it likewise is
longer before it becomes perfectly fine; but, when once
so, will be more lasting.</p>

<p>If the quantities of oil are increased, they will exceed
the power both of the acids naturally contained in the
must, and of those absorbed from the air in fermenting;
the liquor will therefore require a longer time before it
becomes pellucid, unless assisted by precipitation: and
there may be cases where even precipitation cannot fine
it.</p>

<p>These considerations naturally lead us to a general di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>vision
of wines into three classes: First, of such as
soon grow fine, and soon become acid, being the growth
of cold countries. Secondly, of those which, by a due
proportion of heat, both when the grapes germinate, and
when they come to maturity, form a perfect must; and
not only preserve themselves, but, in due time, (more especially
when assisted by precipitation,) become transparent;
and, thirdly, of such as, having taken their
first form under the highest degrees of <i>germination</i>, (as I
termed them) are replete with oils, disappoint the cooper,
and render the application of menstruums useless, unless
in such quantities as to change the very nature of
the wine.</p>

<p>This remarkable difference in wines appears chiefly to
arise from the climate; and it will confirm the observation
before made, that, as wines are neither naturally
nor uniformly perfect, they must be subject to many
diseases.</p>

<p>All vegetable substances possess fermentable principles,
though in a diversity of proportions; for those
juices only, whose constituent parts approach to the
proportion necessary for the act of fermentation, can be
made into wines. I would not, however, from what I
have attributed to a difference of heat in different climates,
be understood, as if I thought that vegetables
are more or less acid, more or less sulphureous, or in
general more or less fermentable, merely from the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of the country they grow in. This, though likely one
of the principal causes of their being so, is by no means
the only one; the form and constitution of the plant is
another. In very hot climates, we find acid fruits, such
as limes, tamarinds, lemons, and oranges; the proportions
of fermentable principles in these fruits are such,
as to render them incapable of making sound wines,
though their juices may, in some degree, be susceptible
of fermentation. In countries greatly favored by the
sun, some vines and other fruit trees there are, which
attract the acids from the air, and possibly from the
earth, so greedily, that, when their juices are fermented,
they soon become sour. On the contrary, in cold climates,
we see warm aromatic vegetables grow, as hops,
horse-raddish, camomile, wormwood, &amp;c. whose principles
cannot, without difficulty, and perhaps not perceptibly,
be brought to ferment. But these instances
must be accounted the extremes on each sides; for in
cold, as well as in hot countries, fruits are produced
susceptible of a perfect natural fermentation: with us,
for example, apples; some species of which are endued
with such austere and aromatic qualities, that their expressed
juices ferment spontaneously, until they become
pellucid, and are capable of remaining in a sound state
many years. From hence it appears, that proper subjects,
which will naturally ferment, for making wines,
may be found in almost every climate. England, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Boerhaave, on this account, is remarkably happy: her
fruits are capable of producing a great variety of wines,
equal in goodness to many imported, were not our tastes
but too often subservient, not to reason, but to custom
and prejudice.</p>

<p>A similar want of perfection to that observed in wines,
may be noticed in our beers and ales, and it chiefly has
its origin in the different degrees of heat the malt has
been impressed with, both in drying and extracting;
where, in the processes of malting and brewing, a sufficient
heat has not been maintained, the liquor undoubtedly
must become acid; in proportion as the contrary is
the case, or that the beer is overcharged with hops, if
this is in no great excess, it retains still a greater tendency
to fermentation than to putrefaction, acids not
being wanting, but only enveloped. In this case, time will
get the better of the disease; like to the wines made
from the growth of too hot a sun, these liquors, at a
certain period, sicken, smell rancid, and have a disagreeable
taste, but, by long standing, they begin to fret, and,
receiving more acids from the air, recover their former
health, and improve in taste.</p>

<p>But should the quantity of oils exceed this last proportion,
in wines formed from corn, the must, instead
of fermenting, would putrify, even though, by some
means, elastic air has been driven into them. In this
case, the over proportion of the oil, and its tenacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
prevents the entrance of the acids, the wort receives no
enlivening principle from without, and the air, at first
conveyed into it, is enveloped with oils so tenacious as
to be incapable of action. Nothing so much accelerates
putrefaction as heat, moisture, and a stagnating air;
and all substances corrupt, sooner or later, in proportion
to the inactivity of the contained air, to the want of a
proper vent, and to the closeness of their confinement.
Besides these cases, beers and ales, as well as wines,
sometimes are vapid and flat, without being sour; this
does not so much arise from the imbibing the air of the
atmosphere, as from their fermenting, generating and
casting off too much air of their own. To prevent this
accident, they are best preserved in cool cellars, where
their active invigorating principles are kept within
due bounds, and not suffered to fly off. These facts
ought to convince us of the truth, deduced by Dr. Hales,
from many experiments, that there is a great plenty of
air incorporated in the substance of vegetables, which,
by the action of fermentation, is roused into an elastic
state, and is as instrumental to produce this act, as it is
necessary to the life and being of animals.</p>

<p>I should here close this short and imperfect account;
but as, in the art of brewing, there is no part so difficult,
and at the same time so important to be in some measure
understood, as the cause and effects of fermentation; and
as the examination of this act, in all the different lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
in which it offers itself to our notice, can hardly be
thought uninteresting, these few detached thoughts I
hope will be allowed of.</p>

<p>The effect of the act of fermentation on liquors is, so to
attenuate the oils; as to cause them to become spiritous,
and easily inflammable. When a wine is dispossessed of
such oils, which is nearly the case in vinegar, far from
possessing a heating or inebriating quality, it refreshes
and becomes a remedy against intoxication. The term
of fermentation ought, perhaps, only to be applied to
that operation which occasions the expressed juices of
vegetables to become wine: but as several acts have assumed
the same name, it may not be improper here to
notice the difference between them.</p>

<p>Vegetation, one of them, is that operation of nature
wherein more air is attracted than repelled. I believe
all that has been said above, concerning the juice of
grapes, is a convincing proof thereof.</p>

<p>Fermentation is, where the communication of the external
and internal air of a must is open, and in a perfect
state; when the power of repelling, is equal to that of attracting,
air.</p>

<p>Putrefaction is when, by the power of strong oils, or
otherwise, the communication between the external and
the internal air of the must is cut off, so that the liquor
neither attracts the one nor repels the other, but, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
an intestine motion, the united particles separate and
tend to fly off.</p>

<p>Effervescence is when, by the power of attraction, the
particles of matter so hastily rush into contact, as to generate
a heat which expels the enclosed air; and this
more or less in proportion to the motion excited.</p>

SECTION IX.<br /><br />

<small><i>OF ARTIFICIAL FERMENTATION.</i></small></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> what has been said, it appears, that, though fermentation
is brought on by uniform causes, and productive
of similar effects, it is subject to many varieties, both
in respect to its circumstances and to its perfection. One
difference is obvious, and seems to deserve our attention,
as it furnishes a useful division between <i>natural</i> and <i>artificial</i>
fermentation. The first rises spontaneously, and
requires nothing to answer all the necessary purposes,
but the perfection of the juices, and the advantage of a
proper heat. The other, at first sight less perfect, wants
the assistance of ferments, or substitutes, without which
the act could, either not at all, or very imperfectly, be
excited.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly liquors, which, though they
have of themselves a tendency to fermentation, and are
naturally brought to it, yet, from some defect in the
proportions of their constituent parts, either do not acquire
a proper transparency, or cannot maintain themselves
in a sound state for a sufficient time. These disadvantages,
inbred with them, can hardly ever be entirely
removed; they gain very little, especially the latter, from
age, and therefore are really inferior to liquors, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
require the assistance of substituted ferments, to become
real wines. In some artificial fermentations, the ferments
are so duly and properly supplied, and so intimately
blended with the liquor, that in the end they approach
very near to, and even vie with, the most perfect natural
wines. Were I to enter into a more minute detail, it
might be shewn, that wines, when transported from a
hot climate to a cold one, are often hurt and checked in
the progress of the repeated frettings they require; from
whence they become or remain imperfect, unless racked
off from their grosser lees, or precipitated with strong
menstruums; whereas beers may be so brewed, as to be
adapted either to a hot or a cold region, not only without
any disadvantage, but with considerable improvements.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have considered grapes as a most pulpous
fruit, sufficient to furnish the quantity of water necessary
for extracting its other parts; but the natives of the
countries where this fruit abounds, in order to preserve
them, as near as possible in their primitive state, after
they are gathered, suspend them in barns, or place them
in ovens, to dry. Thus, being in great measure divested
of their aqueous parts, these grapes remain almost
inactive, and without juices sufficient to form wines.</p>

<p>In all bodies, the various proportions of their constituent
parts produce different effects; hence they remain
more or less in a durable state, and tend either to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>action,
fermentation, or putrefaction. Now, by a judicious
substitution of such parts as shall be wanting, they
are nearly, if not wholly, restored to their pristine nature,
as may be proved by the observations and experiments
communicated to the public by Dr. Pringle. Thus
grapes, though dried and exported from their natural
climate to another, by the addition of water only, ferment
spontaneously, and form wines very near alike to
such as they would have produced before. It may, with
confidence, be said, that, when any considerable difference
appears, it arises from the injudicious manner in
which the water is administered, from the fruit not being
duly macerated, or from want of such heat being conveyed
to the water and fruit, as the juices would have
had, if they had been expressed out of the grapes when
just gathered; often from the whimsical mixture of
other bodies therewith, and perhaps too from the quantity
of brandy, which is always put to wines abroad, to
prevent their fretting on board a ship. Upon the whole,
though, from what just now has been observed, some
small difference must take place, it rather proves than
contradicts the fact, that, a due quantity of water being
applied to dry raisins, an extract may be formed, which
will be impregnated with all the necessary constituent
parts the grapes had in them when ripe upon the vine,
consequently will spontaneously ferment, and make a
vinous liquor. Water then, in this case, becomes a sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>stitute,
and the liquors produced in this manner may be
accounted of the first class of artificial wines.</p>

<p>Vegetables, in their original state, are divisible into
the pulpous and farinaceous kinds, both possessing the
same constituent parts, though in different proportions.
If from the farinaceous such parts be taken away as they
superabound in, and others be added, of which they are
defective, these vegetables may, by such means, be
brought to resemble, in the proportion of their parts,
more especially in their musts, the natural wines I have
before been treating of: and these being universally acknowledged
to be the standard of wines, the nearer any
fermented liquor approaches thereto, by its lightness,
transparency, and taste, the greater must its perfection
be.</p>

<p>To enquire which of the pulpous or which of the farinaceous
kinds of vegetables are fittest for the purpose
of wine-making, would here be an unnecessary digression.
Experience, the best guide, hath, on the one side,
given the preference to the fruit of the vine, and on the
other to barley. To make a vinous liquor from barley,
having all the properties of that produced from the
grape, is a task, which can only be compassed by rendering
the wort of these, similar to the must of the
other.</p>

<p>As malt liquors require the addition of other substitutes,
besides water, to, become perfect wines, they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
only be ranked in the <i>second</i> class of <i>artificial</i> fermentation.
These substitutes are properly called <i>ferments</i>,
and merit the brewer’s closest attention.</p>

<p>Ferments, in general, such as yeast, flowers or lees of
wine, honey, the expressed juices of ripe fruits, are subjects
more or less replete with elastic air, and convey
the same to musts, which stand in need thereof. Boerhaave
has ranged these, and several others, in different
classes, according to their different powers, or rather in
proportion to the quantity of air they contain for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The juice of the grape, when fermented, forms more
lees than the extracts of malt. May we not, from thence,
infer that, in the fruit, the elastic air is both more abundant,
and contained in a greater number of stronger,
though smaller, vesicles, than it is in the malt? The barley,
being first saturated with water, germinated only,
and then dried with a heat far exceeding that which
ripened it, or that which fermentation admits of, has its
air in part driven out. The expulsion of air from
the worts of beers and ales is still farther effected by the
long boiling they undergo. Hence the necessity of replacing
the lost elastic air, in order that these extracts
may become fermentable. This is effected by means of
the yeast, which, consisting of a collection of small bubbles,
filled with air, and ready to burst by a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
heat, becomes the ferment, which facilitates the change
of the wort into a vinous liquor.</p>

<p>The musts of malt generally produce two gallons of
yeast from eight bushels of the grain, whereas, in the
coldest fermentable weather, and for the speediest purpose,
one gallon of yeast is sufficient to work this quantity
of malt. Much elastic air still remains in beer, or
wine from corn, after the first part of the fermentation is
over; for the liquor, separated from the yeast above mentioned,
is, at the time of this separation, neither flat,
vapid, nor sour; but as yeast, the lees and flowers of
malt liquors are of a weaker texture than those of grapes,
all artificial fermentations should be carried on in the
coolest and slowest manner possible: and beers, but more
especially such as are brewed from high-dried,
brown malts, (the heat of whose extracts approaches
much nearer to that which dried the grain, than is the
case in brewing pale malt) ought not to be racked from
their lees, as it is frequently practised for natural wines,
unless, on account of some defect, they are to be blended
with fresh worts under a new fermentation.</p>

<p>As all ferments are liable to be tainted, great care
ought to be taken in the choice of them, every imperfection
in the ferment being readily communicated to the
must. It would not, therefore, be an improper question
to be determined by physicians, whether, in a time of
sickness, the use of those which have been made in in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>fected
places ought to be permitted, and whether, at all
times, a drink fermented in a pure and wholesome air is
not preferable to that which is made among fogs, smoke,
and nauseous stenches.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Wines from corn are distinguished by two appellations,
viz., those of ale and beer. As each of these liquors
have suffered in character, either from prejudice
or want of a sufficient enquiry, it may be proper to levy
the objections made against their use, before we enquire
into the means of forming them. The most certain sign
of the wholesomeness of wines is transparency and
lightness; yet some, which are rich, more especially ales,
though perfectly fine, have been said to be viscid.&mdash;Transparency
appears indeed in many wines, before the
oils are attenuated to their highest perfection, and some
viscidity may therefore be consistent with some degree
of brightness. Where the power of the oils and the
salts are equal, which is denoted by the transparency of
the liquor, viscidity can only arise from the want of age:
this cannot be said to be a defect in, but only misapplication
of the liquor, by being used too soon.</p>

<p>That beers retain igneous or fiery particles, seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>equally a mistake. Malt dried to keep, has undoubtedly
its particles removed by fire, so far as the cohesion of
them is thereby destroyed, otherwise it would not be in
a fit state to preserve itself sound, or readily to be extracted.
For this reason, when the grain comes in contact
with the water, which is to resolve it, an effervescent
heat is generated, which adds to the extracting power, and
should be looked on by the brewer as an auxiliary help;
but it is impossible that the malt, or the must, should
ever inclose and confine the whole or part of fire employed
to form them. Fire is of so subtile a nature, that
its particles, when contained in a body, continually tend
to fly off, and mix with the surrounding air; so that
only an equal degree, with what is in the atmosphere,
can be continued in the grain, or any liquor whatever,
after it has been, for some time, exposed thereto.&mdash;Brown
beers, made from malt more dried than any other,
from experience, are found to be less heating than liquors
brewed from pale malt; which probably arises
from hence, that brown beers contain a less quantity of
elastic air than pale beers, as pale malt liquors contain
less than wines, produced from vegetables in their natural
state: and as malt liquors contain their elastic air in
bubbles of a weaker consistence than those made from
the juices of the grape, the effect of beer, when taken in
an over-abundant quantity, is neither of so long a continuance,
nor so powerful as that of wine, supposing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
quality and quantity of each to be equal. This may appear
to some persons to be the effect of prejudice, yet it
is but a justice due to the produce of my country, to
add, that some physicians have given it as their opinion,
that strong drinks from malt are less pernicious than
those produced from grapes. As far as these gentlemen
have, I hope I may advance, without being thought
guilty of assuming too much, or countenancing debauch,
by pointing out the wines that occasion the fewest disorders.</p>

SECTION X.<br /><br />

<small><i>OF THE NATURE OF BARLEY.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Barley</span> is a spicated, oblong, ventricose seed,
pointed at each end, and marked with a longitudinal
furrow. The essential constitution of the parts, in all
plants, says Dr. Grew, is the same: thus this seed,
like those which have lobes, is furnished with radical
vessels, which, having a correspondence with the whole
body of the corn, are always ready, when moistened,
to administer support to the plume of the embryo, usually
called the <i>acrospire</i>. These radical vessels, at first, receive
their nourishment from a great number of glandules
dispersed almost every where in the grain, whose pulpous
parts strain and refine this food, so as to fit it to enter
the capillary tubes; and such an abundant provision is
made for the nourishment of the infant plant, that the
same author says, these glandules take up more than
nine tenths of the seed.</p>

<p>Barley is sown about March, sooner or later, according
to the season or soil that is to receive it, and generally
housed from ten to twenty weeks after. Most plants,
which so hastily perform the office of vegetation, are remarkable
for having their vessels proportionably larger;
and that these may be thus formed, the seed must con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>tain
a greater quantity of tenacious oils, in proportion to
those seeds, whose vessels being smaller, require more
time to perform their growth and come to maturity.
This grain, as may be observed, grows and ripens with
the lower degrees of natural heat; from whence, and
from the largeness of the size of its absorbent vessels, it
must receive a great portion of acid parts. It is said to
be viscid, though, at the same time, a great cooler, water
boiled with it being often drunk as such; and, however
it be prepared, it never heats the body when unfermented.</p>

<p>From these circumstances, of its being viscous and replete
with acids, it would at first appear to be a most
unfit vegetable, from which vinous liquors, to be long
kept, should be made; and, indeed, the extracts from
it, in its original state, are not only clammy, but soon
become sour.</p>

<p>When the grain is at full maturity, its constituent parts
seem to be differently disposed than when in a state of
vegetation. By germination alone all its principles are
put in action; the fibrous parts possess themselves of a
great quantity of tenacious oils, leaving the glandules
and finer vessels replete with water, salts, and the purest
sulphur. If, in this state, the corn is placed in such a
situation, that, by heat, the acid and watery parts may
be evaporated, the more such heat is suffered to affect
it, the more dry, and less acid, will the corn become;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
its parts will be divided&mdash;its viscidity removed; its taste
becomes saccharine, by the acids being sheathed or covered
over with oils; and these last be rendered more tenacious
in proportion to the greater quantity of heat
they are made to endure. This process, regularly carried
on, is termed <i>malting</i>, and will hereafter be explained
more at large.</p>

<p>But, before we enter thereon, it is necessary to consider
the state of the grain as it comes from the field.&mdash;When
mowed, though, upon the whole, it may be said
to be ripe, yet every individual part, or every corn,
cannot be so. In some seasons, this inequality is so remarkable,
as to be distinguished by the eye. The difference
in the situation, the soil, and the weather, the
changes of the winds, the shelter some parts of the field
have had from such winds, are sufficient to account for
this, and a much greater variety. When the greater
part of the corn is supposed to have come to maturity,
it is cut and stacked; the ripest parts having the least
moisture, and the fewest acids, as the greenest abound
in both. In this state the unripe grains of the corn communicate,
to such as are more dry, their moisture and
acid parts, which, coming in contact with their oils, an
agitation ensues, more or less gentle, in proportion to
the power of the acids and water; and from hence is generated
a heat, the degree whereof is with difficulty determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>When this sweating in the mow is kept within its proper
limits, the whole heap of the corn, after this internal
emotion is over, becomes of one equable dryness,
and is not discoloured; but if the grain be put together
too wet or too green, the effervescence occasioned thereby
will produce such a violent intestine heat, as to charr
and blacken the greatest part thereof, nay often make
it burst into actual flame.</p>

<p>The effect which a moderate and gentle heat has on
the corn, is that of driving the oils towards the external
parts of its vessels and skin: by this means, it becomes
more capable to preserve itself against the injuries of the
weather. The more it is in this state, the backwarder will
it be to germinate, when used to this purpose; and if
this act is carried too far, or to somewhat like what we
have just now mentioned, the plume and root of the enclosed
embryo must be scorched, the corn become inert,
and incapable of vegetation. This effect is produced
by a motion sufficient to remove the particles of
the grain from each other beyond their sphere of attraction;
and the heat, by which this motion is excited, has
been found, in malted corn, to be at about 120 degrees.</p>

<p>It is likely, that vegetables, in general, are susceptible
of a large latitude in this respect, according to their different
textures. The degree of heat just now mentioned
may, perhaps, be applicable to barley alone;
the seeds of some grapes endure 126 degrees of heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and may be capable of being impressed with more, and
yet vegetate. But, with corn, if their oils have endured
so great a heat, as thereby to be discolored, the seed
can by no means be revived. The color of the grain
properly indicates the healthy state of the embryo, or
future plant; but this, more immediately, is the business
of the farmer and maltster, than that of the brewer.</p>

<p>Thus, though it may be disadvantageous to the maltster
to steep grain which has not sweated in the mow,
as, for want of this, it will not equally imbibe the water;
so barley, that is over-heated, or <i>mow burnt</i>, cannot be
fit for his purpose. It is, in fact, scarcely possible that
any large quantity of barley, from the same stack, should
make equally perfect malt, as, on its being put together,
the heat generated is always greatest in the centre of the
rick, and considerably more there than in its exterior
parts.</p>

<small><i>OF MALTING.</i></small></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> process is intended to furnish proper means, for
setting the constituent principles of the grain in motion:
so that the oils, which before served to defend the several
parts, may be enabled to take their proper stations.&mdash;This
is effected by steeping the barley in water, where
it strongly attracts moisture, as all dry bodies do; but it
requires some time before the grain is fully saturated
therewith.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Two or three days, more or less, are necessary,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>very fine, that they require this element to be reduced almost
to a vapor, before it can gain admittance. Heat
hath not only the property of expanding these pores, but
perhaps also that of adding to the water a power more
effectually to insinuate itself.</p>

<p>By the water gaining admittance into the corn, a great
quantity of air is expelled from it, as appears from the
number of bubbles which arise on its surface when in
contact with the grain, though yet much remains therein.
A judgment is formed that the corn is fully saturated,
so as not to be able to imbibe any more water, from
its turgidity and pulpousness, which occasions it readily
to give way to an iron rod dropped perpendicularly
therein. At this time the water is let to run, or drawn
off, the grain taken out of the cistern, and laid in a regular
heap, in height about two feet. We have before accounted
why moist vegetables, when stacked together,
grow hot; so doth this heap of barley. The heat, assisted
by the moisture, puts in motion the acids, oils,
and elastic air remaining in the corn, and these not only
mollify and soften the radical vessels, but, with united
power, force the juices from the glandular parts into the
roots, which are thereby disposed to expand themselves,
and impowered to convey nourishment to the embryo
enveloped in the body of the grain. The corn in this
heap, or couch, is however not suffered to acquire so
great a degree of heat, as to carry on germination too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
fast, by which not only the finer but also the coarser
oils would be raised and entangled together, and the
malt when made become bitter and ill tasted; but before
the acrospire is perceived to lengthen, the barley is dispersed
in beds on the floor of the malt house, and, from
being at first spread thin, gradually, as it dries, and as the
germination is thereby checked in its progress, it is
thrown into larger bodies; so that, at the latter part of this
operation, which generally employs two days, much of
the moisture is evaporated, its fibres are spread, and the
acrospire near coming through the outward skin of the
barley. By these signs the malster is satisfied that every
part of the barley has been put in motion and separated.
It is of great consequence, in making of malt, that the
grain be dried by a very slow and gradual heat: for this
purpose it is now thrown into a large heap, and there
suffered to grow sensibly hot, as it will in about 20 or 30
hours: thus prepared for drying, in this lively and active
condition, it is spread on the kiln; where, meeting with
a heat superior to that requisite for vegetation, its farther
growth is stopped; though, in all probability, from
the gentleness of the first fire it ought to be exposed to,
none of the finer vessels are, by this sudden change, rent
or torn, but, by drying, only the cohesion of its parts removed,
rendered inactive, and put in a preservative state.
Often, to a fault, the drying of a kiln of malt is performed
in 6 or 8 hours: it would be to the advantage of the grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
that more than double this time was employed for any
intent whatever. It may here be observed, that those
oils, which in part form the roots, being with them
pushed out from the body of the corn, and dried by heat,
are lost to any future wort, not being soluble in water;
which is likewise true of those oils which are contained
in the shoot or plume; so that the internal part of the
malt has remaining in it a greater proportion of salts to
the oils than before, consequently are less viscid, more
saccharine, and easier to be extracted.</p>

<p>In this process, the acid parts of the grain, though
they are the most ponderous, yet being very attractive
of water, become weaker, and, by the continued heat of
the kiln, are volatilized and evaporated with the aqueous
steam of the malt. Thus, by malting, the grain acquires
new properties, and these vary at the different stages of
dryness; in the first it resembles the fruits ripened by a
weaker sun, and in the last those which are the growth of
the hottest climates.</p>

<p>When the whiteness of the barley has not been greatly
changed by the heat it has been kept in, it is called pale
malt, from its having retained its original color; but
when the fire in the kiln has been made more vehement,
or kept up a longer time, it affects both the oils and the
salts of the grain, in proportion to the degree of the heat,
and to the time it has been maintained, and thus occasions
a considerable alteration in the color. Actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
blackness seldom is, and ought never to be, suffered in
malts; but in proportion to the intenseness of the fire
they have been exposed to, the nearer do they come to
that tinge, and from the different brown they shew, receive
their several denominations.</p>

<p>The condition the barley was gathered in, whether
green or ripe, is also clearly discernible when it is malted.
If gathered green, it rather loses than gains in quantity;
for the stock of oils in unripe corn being small, the
whole is spent in germination, from whence the malt becomes
of a smaller body, appears shrivelled, and is often
unkindly, or hard. That, on the contrary, which hath
come to full maturity, increases by malting, and if properly
carried through the process, appears plump, bright,
clean, and, on being cracked, readily yields the fine mealy
parts, so much desired by the brewer.</p>

<p>The malts, when dried to the pitch intended by the
maker, are removed from the kiln into a heap. Their
heat gradually diminishes, and, from the known properties
of fire, flies off, and disperses itself in the ambient
air, sooner or later, as the heap is more or less voluminous;
perhaps too in some proportion to the weight of
the malt, and as the fire has caused it to be more or less
tenacious. Nor can it be supposed that any of its parts
are capable of retaining the fire in such a manner as not
to suffer it to get away. So subtile an element cannot be
confined, much less be kept in a state of inactivity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
imperceptible to our senses. Bars of iron, or brass, even
of a considerable size, when heated red hot, cool and lose
their fire, though their texture is undoubtedly much
closer than that of malt or barley. The experiments
made by Dr. Martine, on the heating and cooling of several
bodies, leave no room to doubt of this fact, which
I should not be so particular about, nor in some measure
repeat, was it not to explain the technical phrase used by
brewers, when they say, <i>malts are full of fire, or want
fire</i>. Hence a prejudice hath by some been conceived
against drinks made from brown malts, though they have
been many months off the kiln, and have no more heat in
them, either whole or ground, than the air they are kept
in. The truth of the matter is, that, in proportion as
malts are dried, their particles are more or less separated
from one another, their cohesion is thereby broke, and,
coming in contact with another body, such as water,
strongly attract from it the uniting particles they want.
The more violent this intestine motion is, the greater is
the heat just then generated, though not durable. An
effect somewhat similar to what happens on malt being
united with water, must occur on the grain being masticated;
and the impression made on the palate most probably
gave rise to the technical expression just taken notice
of.</p>

<p>The minute circumstances of the process of malting
will be more readily conceived from what will hereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
be said. The effects that fire will have, at several degrees,
on what, from having been barley, is now become
malt, are more particularly the concern of the brewer;
and that these differ, both as to the color and properties,
is certain. A determinate degree of heat produces, on
every body, a certain alteration, and hence, as the action
of fire is stronger or weaker, the effect will not be the
same as what it would have been in any other degree.</p>

<p>Barleys, at a medium, may be said to lose, by malting,
one fourth part of their weight, including what is separated
from them by the roots being skreened off: but
this proportion varies, according as they are more or less
dried.</p>

<p>As the acrospire, and both the outward and inward
skins of the grain are not dissoluble in water, the glandular
or mealy substance is certainly very inconsiderable in
volume and weight: but as in this alone are contained
the fermentable principles of the grain, it deserves our
utmost attention.</p>

<p>We have before seen, that wines, beers, and ales, after
the first fermentation, are meliorated through age by the
more refined and gentle agitations they undergo, and
which often are not perceptible to our senses. To secure
this favorable effect, we must form worts capable
of maintaining themselves, for some time, in a sound
state. This quality, however, if not originally in the
malt, is not to be expected in the liquor. Some objec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>tions
have been raised against this method of arguing,
and these aided by prejudices, often more powerful
than the objections themselves. It is therefore necessary,
as malting may be esteemed the foundation of all our
future success, to enquire after the best and properest
methods of succeeding in this process. Let us, for this
purpose, reassume the consideration of the grain, as it
comes from the mow, trace it to the kiln, and observe
every change it undergoes by the action of the fire,
from the time that it receives the first degree of preservation,
to that when it is utterly altered and nearly destroyed.</p>

<p>Barley in the mow, though there its utmost heat should
not much exceed 100 degrees, may be extracted or
brewed without malting. This the distiller’s practice
daily evinces; but then the extracts, made from this unchanged
corn, are immediately put in the still after the
first fermentation, else they would not long remain in a
sound state. Nor is this method practicable in summer
time, as the extracts would turn sour, before they were
sufficiently cooled to ferment. It is true, by this means,
all the charge of the malt duty is saved; but our spirits
thereby are greatly inferior to those of the French.&mdash;Boerhaave
recommends the practice of that nation, which
is to let the wines ferment, subside, and be drawn off fine
from the lees, before they are distilled. Was this rule
observed in England, distillation would be attempted only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
from malted grain, which, if properly extracted for this
purpose, the difference in the spirit would soon shew
how useful and necessary it is to give wines (either from
grapes or corn) time to be softened, and to gain some
degree of vinosity before they are used to this intent.</p>

<p>But might not barleys be dried without being germinated?
Undoubtedly they might; but as they abound
with many acids and strong oils, they would require a
heat more intense than malt does, before they were sufficiently
penetrated, and then the oleaginous parts would
become so compact, and so resinous, as nearly to acquire
the consistence of a varnish, scarcely to be mollified
by the hottest water, and hardly ever to be entirely
dissolved by that element.</p>

<p>Barley then ungerminated, either in its natural state
or when dried, is not fit for the purpose of making
wines; but when, by germination, the coarser oils are
expelled, and the mealy parts of the grain become saccharine,
might not this suffice, and where is the necessity
of the grain being dried by fire? I shall not dwell
on the impossibility of stopping germination at a proper
period, without the assistance of fire, so that sufficient
quantities of the grain, thus prepared, may always be
provided for the purposes of brewing; nor even insist
upon the difficulty of grinding such grain, as, in this case,
it would be spongy and tough. I think it sufficient to
mention solely the unfitness of this imperfect malt, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the purpose it is to be applied to, that of forming beers
and ales capable of preserving themselves for some time.
We should find so many acids blended with the water
still remaining in the grain, that, in the most favorable
seasons for brewing, they would often render all our endeavors
abortive, and, in summer time, make it impracticable
to obtain from them sound extracts in any
manner whatever.</p>

<p>I have heard of a project of germinating grain, and
drying it by the heat of the sun, in summer time, in order,
by this means, to save the expence of fuel. Though
the hottest days in England may be thought sufficient for
this act, as well as for making hay, yet, as barley and
grass are not of equal densities, the effects would not be
the same. This, however, is not the only objection:
as the corn, after a sufficient germination, should be
made inactive, this very hot season, favorable, in appearance,
to one part of the process, would rather forward,
than stop or retard, vegetation; for the barley, by this
heat, would shoot and come forward so fast as to entangle
too much the constituent principles of the grain with one
another, and drive the coarser ill-tasted oils among the
finer sweet mealy parts, which alone, in their utmost
purity, are the subject required for such as would obtain
good drinks.</p>

<p>There often appears in mankind a strange disposition
to wish for the gifts of Providence, in a different man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>ner
than they have been allotted to us. The various
schemes I have just now mentioned, if I mistake not,
have sprung from the desire of having beers and ales of
the same appearance with white wines. But as they are
naturally more yellow or brown, when brewed from
malts dried by heats equal or superior to that which constitutes
them such, all such projects, by which we endeavour
to force some subjects to be of a like color with
others, are but so many attempts against nature, and the
prosecution of them must commonly be attended with disappointments.
It is true, that though the germinated
grain be dried slack, yet; if they are speedily used, and
brewed in the most proper season, they may make a tolerable
drink, which will preserve itself sound for some
time: but the proportion, which should be kept between
the heat which dried the malt, and that which is to
extract it, cannot, in this case, be truly ascertained; and,
as the grain will be more replete with air, water, and
acids, than it ought to be, the drink, even supposing
the most fortunate success, and that it does not soon
turn acid, will still be frothy, and therefore greatly
wanting in salubrity; for an excess in any of the fermentable
principles must always be hurtful.</p>

<p>Barley then, to be made fit for the purpose of brewing,
must be malted; that is, it must be made to sprout
or germinate with degrees of heat nearly equal to those
which the seed should be impressed with when sown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the ground; and it must be dried with a heat superior
to that of vegetation, and capable of checking it. How
far germination should be carried on, we have already
seen; the law seems to be fixed universally, as to the
extent of the acrospire: the degree of dryness admits of
a larger latitude, the limits of which shall be the subject
of our next enquiry.</p>

<p>Malt dried in so low a degree, as that the vegetative
power is not entirely destroyed, on laying together in a
heap, will generate a considerable degree of heat, germinate
afresh, and send forth its plume or acrospire
quite green. The ultimate parts of the nourishing principles
are then within each other’s power of acting, else
this regermination could not take place; and such grain
cannot be said to be malted, or in a preservative state.
Bodies, whose particles are removed, by heat, beyond
their sphere of attraction, can no more germinate; but,
coming in contact with other bodies, as malt with water,
they effervesce. The grain we are now speaking of first
shews this act of effervescence, when it has been thoroughly
impressed with a heat of 120 degrees, and a
little before its color, from a white, begins to incline to
the yellow. Such are the malts, which are cured in a
manner to be able to maintain themselves sound, though
in this state, and at this degree of dryness, they possess
as much air, and as many acid and watery particles, as
their present denomination can admit of. This there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>fore
may be termed the first or lowest degree of drying
this grain for malt.</p>

<p>To discover the last or greatest degree of heat it is capable
of enduring, the circumstance to guide us to it,
though equally true, is not so near at hand as effervescence,
which helped us to the first. We must therefore
have recourse to the observation of that heat, which
wholly deprives the grain of its principal virtues. Dr.
Shaw observes, <i>alcohol is one of the most essential parts
of wine</i>; when absent, the wine loses its nature, and,
when properly diffused, it is a certain remedy for most
diseases incident to wines, and keeps them sound and
free from corruption; from whence was derived the method
of preserving vegetable and animal substances.&mdash;The
same excellent author had before this observed,
that <i>no subjects but those of the vegetable kingdom are
found to produce this preserving spirit</i>. Is alcohol, then,
a new body, created by fermentation and distillation; or
did it originally, though latently, reside in the vegetable?
<i>I have for a good while been satisfied, by experiments</i>,
says Boerhaave, <i>that all other inflammable
bodies are so only as they contain alcohol in them, or, at
least, something that, on account of its fineness, is exceedingly
like it; the grosser parts thereof, that are left
behind, after a separation of this subtile one, being no
longer combustible</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as the same author has clearly proved<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> that fire,
by burning combustible bodies, as well as by distilling
them, separates their different inflammable principles,
according to their various degrees of subtilty, the alcohol
residing in the barley, when exposed to such a degree
of heat as would cause it to boil, i. e. 175 degrees, must
make great efforts to disengage itself from the grain. Is
it not, therefore, natural to conclude, that, in a body
like malt, whose parts have been made to recede from
one another, (from whence it is porous, and easily affected
by fire,) prepared for fermentation, or the making a
vinous liquor, this event will probably happen at the same
time when the body of the grain has been ultimately
divided by fire, or that malt charrs? and if this is true,
may not charring be termed the last degree of dryness,
when, even somewhat before it takes place, the acid
parts and finest oils, which are necessary for forming a
fermentable must, fly off, and cannot be recovered.&mdash;Charring
seems to be a crisis in solid bodies, somewhat
analogous to ebullition in fluids; both being thereby perfectly
saturated with fire, their volatile and spiritous
parts tend to fly off. In charring, the subject being ultimately
divided by fire, the constituent principles are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>set at liberty, and escape in the atmosphere, in proportion
to their several degrees of subtilty, and to the fire
which urged them. In boiling they are equally divided,
and incline to disperse; but, even the more volatile,
being surrounded with water, a medium much denser
than themselves, they are caught up therein, and, by
the violent motion caused in boiling, entangled with it,
and with other parts it contains, so as not to be extricated
or divided therefrom except by the act of fermentation.
Now, as liquors boil with a greater or less fire
in proportion to their tenacity and gravity, solid bodies
may likewise be charred by various proportions of heat.
The whole body of the barley, as its different parts are
of different texture, cannot, at the same instant, become
black, nor, where any quantity of the grain is under
similar circumstances, if not equally germinated, can
the whole charr with the same degree.</p>

<p>To the several reflections, before made, I thought proper
to add the surer help of experience. I therefore
made the following trial, with all the care I was capable
of. If the effects of it appear satisfactory, by gaining
two limited and distant degrees, we may determine and
fix the properties of the intermediate spaces, in proportion
to their expansion.</p>

<p>In an earthen pan, of about two feet diameter, and
three inches deep, I put as much of the palest malt, unequally
grown, as filled it on a level to the brim. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
I placed over a little charcoal, lighted in a small stove,
and kept continually stirring it from bottom to top.</p>

<p>At first it did not feel so damp as it did about half an
hour after. In about an hour more, it began to look of
a bright orange color on the outside, and appeared more
swelled than before. Every one is sensible that a long-continued
custom makes us sufficient judges of colors,
and this sense in a brewer is sufficiently exercised. Then
I masticated some of the grain, and found them to be
nearly such as are termed brown malts. On stirring,
and making a heap of them, towards the middle, I placed
therein, at about half depth, the bulb of my thermometer;
it rose to 140 degrees: the malt felt very damp, and
had but little smell.</p>

<p>At 165 degrees, I examined it in the same manner as
before, and could perceive no damp; the malt was very
brown, and on being chewed, some few black specks appeared.</p>

<p>Many corns, nearest the bottom, were now become
black, and burnt; I placed my thermometer nearly there,
and it rose to 175 degrees: but, as the particles of fire,
ascending from the stove, act on the thermometer, in
proportion to the distance of the situation it is placed in,
through the whole experiment an abatement of five degrees
should be allowed, as near as I could estimate.&mdash;Putting,
a little after, my thermometer in the same position,
where about half the corns were black, it shewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
180 degrees. I now judged that the water was nearly
evaporated, and observed the heap grew black apace.</p>

<p>Again, in the centre of the heap, raised in the middle
of the pan, I found the thermometer at 180 degrees; the
corn tasted burnt, the surface appeared, about one half
part a full brown, and the rest black. On being masticated,
still some white specks appeared, which I observed
to proceed from those barley-corns which had not
been thoroughly germinated, and whose parts cohering
more closely together, the fire, at this degree, had not
penetrated. The thermometer was now more various,
as it was nearer to, or farther from, the bottom; and, in
my opinion, all the true-made malt was charred, for
their taste was insipid, they were brittle, and their skins
parting from the kernel.</p>

<p>I, nevertheless, continued the experiment, and, at 190
degrees, still found some white specks on chewing the
grain; the acrospire always appearing of a deeper black,
or brown, than the outward skin; the corn, at this juncture,
fried at the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>I still increased the fire; and the thermometer, placed
in the middle, between the bottom of the pan, and the
upper edge of the corn, shewed 210 degrees. The malt
hissed, fried, and smoked abundantly. Though, during
the whole process, the grain had been kept stirring, yet,
on examination, the whole was not equally affected by
the fire. A great part thereof was reduced to perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
cinders, easily crumbling to dust between the fingers,
some of a very black hue, without gloss, some very
black, with oil shining on the outside. Upon the whole,
two thirds of the corn were perfectly black, and the rest
of a deep brown, but more or less so, as the grains were
hard, steely, or imperfectly germinated. This was easily
discovered by the length of the shoot: most of the
grains seemed to have lost their cohesion, and had a taste
resembling that of high-roasted coffee.</p>

<p>In the last stage of charring the malt, I placed over it
a wine glass inverted, into which arose a pinguious oily
matter, and tasted very salt. It may, perhaps, not be
unnecessary to say, that the length of time this experiment
took up, was four hours, and that the effect it had,
both on myself, and on the person who attended me,
was such as greatly resembled that of inebriation.</p>

<p>Though, from this experiment, the degree of heat at
which malt charrs, is not fixed with the utmost precision,
yet we see that black specks appeared, when the
thermometer was at 165 degrees; some of the corns were
entirely black at 175, others at 180. In proportion as
fire causes a deficiency of color, it must occasion a want
of fermentable properties, the whole of which are certainly
dispersed, when the grain becomes of an absolute
black. Thus we may conclude, with an exactness surely
sufficient for the purposes of brewing, that true germinated
malts are charred in heats, at about 175 degrees:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
as these correspond to the heat at which pure alcohol, or
the finest spirit of the grain itself, boils, it seems to require
this heat, wholly to extricate itself from the more
tenacious parts of the corn; which, when deprived of this
etherial enlivening principle, remains inert, incapable of
forming a fermentable must or wort, and indicates to us,
that the constituent parts of vegetables may be resolved
by heats, equal to those between the first degree which
formed them, and the last, which ultimately destroys
their properties; though the extracts will possess different
qualities or virtues, according to the determinate
heat which is applied.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> consequences resulting from the before-mentioned
experiment have already been hinted at. But it is necessary
to trace them farther, and to shew how much
they tend to the information and use of the brewer.</p>

<p>Germinated barleys, so little dried, as that their particles
remain within their sphere of attraction, are not in a
preservative state, and therefore cannot properly be
termed malts.</p>

<p>The first degree of dryness, which constitutes them
such, as we have seen before, is that which occasions
them to cause some effervescence. This cannot be
effected, when they are dried with less than 120 degrees
of heat; the highest that leaves them white. When urged
by a fire of 175 degrees, they are charred, black, and totally
void of fermentable principles. Now this difference
of heat, being 55 degrees, and producing in the grain so
great an alteration, as from white to black, the different
shades or colors, belonging to the intermediate degrees,
cannot, with a little practice, be easily mistaken.</p>

<p>White, we know, from Sir Isaac Newton’s experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>ments,
is a composition of all colors, as black is owing
to the absence of them. These two terms indicate the
extremes of the dryness of malt. The color, which the
medium heat impresses upon it, is brown, which, being
compounded of yellow and red, the four tinges which
shade malt differently, may be said to be white, yellow,
red and black. The following table, constructed on
these principles, will, on chewing the grain, readily inform
the practitioner of the degree to which his malts
have been dried. It is true some doubts have arisen, whether
the increase of heat is by equal divisions (according
to the scales marked on thermometers) or whether the
degrees should not rather be in proportional parts: but if
the effect of fire on bodies (as every experiment shews)
is exactly corresponding to the expansion it is the cause

<p>N. B. The several letters against each degree, it is apprehended,
will help in practice to fix the color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing table not only enables us to judge of the
dryness of the malt by its color, but also, when a grist is
composed of several sorts of malt, to foresee the effect of
the whole when blended together by extraction. Some
small error may possibly occur in judgments thus formed
upon the report of our senses; but as malt occupies different
volumes, in proportion to its dryness, if, in the
practice of brewing, upon mixing the water with the
malt, the expected degree is observed, such parcel of
malt may be said to have been judged of rightly, in regard
to its dryness. So that the first trial either confirms
or corrects our opinion thereof.</p>

<p>Though malt, dried to 120 degrees, is in a preservative
state, yet is it the least so as malt: it then possesses
the whole of its fermentable principles, which, if not impeded
in the extraction, would be very speedy and active:
the duration of the worts to be formed from grain
so low dried, must entirely depend on the power given to
the water by heat, to draw from the malt, oils of such consistence
as shall sheath and retard the hasty effects of the
fermentable parts. By extraction, then, malted grain,
even so low dried as this, may, with very hot waters, and
with the farther assistance of hops, be made to produce
beers, which for years will be capable of maintaining
themselves sound, or for a long time to resist the effects of
the hottest climates. They may also, by a less heat being
given to the extracting water, and blended with less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
hops, form drinks, which shall be fit for use in so short a
time as a week, and perhaps a term much shorter: hence
we see the degree of heat which dried the malt, and the
degree of heat given to the water to extract it. The
mean of these numbers (making an allowance for the
quantity of hops used) is that which directs us to fix the
properties and duration of the wort. In one sense, then,
we may consider malt, so low dried as this, as being such
as would in the shortest time furnish us with a fermented
liquor, and in another, such as would yield the most delicate
and strongest drink. When malt charrs, and
becomes black, its parts are ultimately divided; it
has lost the principles fit to form a fermentable wort,
and which it once possessed. The degree of heat,
prior to that which produces this effect, is the last
which still retains any part of the fermentable properties.
In worts from malt thus highly impressed by
fire, fermentation would proceed with so slow and reluctant
a pace, that, in this case, they might be
said to be in the utmost state of preservation. No term
can be fixed for their duration. A liquor of this sort,
brewed with the greatest heat it would admit of, in the
extracting water, might keep many years, and become
rather accommodated to the temperature of the place it
was deposited in, than to its own constituent parts. Experience
has shewn, that drinks, impressed by the drying
and extracting heat, with a medium of 148 degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with a proper addition of hops, at the end of eighteen
months, have been found sound, and in a drinkable
state; and at this degree we find the middling brown.&mdash;From
these two extremes, and on these principles, the
following table is formed, exhibiting the length of time
drinks made from malt, impressed with each respective
degree of heat, properly brewed, in the most favourable
season, will require, before they come to their due perfection
to be used.</p>

<p>Equally as with hot extracting waters, low dried pale
malt may be made to yield beers which will long continue
in a sound state; so high dried malt, acted upon by
cooler and low extracting water, may be made to furnish
a wort soon fit for use, though less agreeable and more
inelegant. It might here be asked, why, then, at any
time, is malt dried with heats exceeding 120 degrees?
In answer to this, it might justly be said, it would be
very difficult for the malster exactly to hit this point of
drying, without deviating from it either on the one side
or on the other; and suppose this difficulty removed,
still he could not be certain every individual grain was
equally affected: if the drying was less than 120 degrees,
the malt, by receiving the moist impressions of the air,
would regerminate, and be spoiled. Before the use of
hops, malt was high dried, as a means to keep the extracts
sound. To eradicate an ancient custom or prejudice
requires a long time. This, and the conveniency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
keeping malts, was the reason why, for many years, it
was in general dried to excess; an error which for some
time past has been losing ground, as no reason at
present subsists, why malts should exceed in color a
light amber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>
<p>It must be observed, that the foregoing table is constructed
on the supposition, that these different sorts of
malt are brewed, fermented with the utmost care, with
waters heated to extract it, in proportion to the dryness
of the grain, and to intent of time there set down, and
with an adequate addition of hops; an ingredient which
shall be considered in its proper place. What is meant
by the water being heated to extract malt in proportion
to the dryness of the grain, may merit some explanation.</p>

<p>Grapes, when ripe, carry with them the water they
have received, both during their growing state, and that
of their maturity. This quantity is sufficient to form
their musts with. To dried grapes or raisins, water is
added, to supply what they have lost; and for the same
reason it is requisite in regard to malt: but as grapes
stand in no need of artificial fire, to give to their fermentative
principles a due proportion, so what they produce
themselves, or cold water applied to them, when dry, is
a sufficient menstruum. But barleys, wanting the assistance
of a great heat to bring their parts to the necessary
proportion, require, when malt, a similar or rather a
greater heat to resolve them: without which, experiment
shews, the flour of the grain would come away un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>dissolved,
and thus considerably impoverish the grist.&mdash;Should,
on the other hand, too great a heat be applied,
an equal loss would be sustained, from some of the finer
parts being coagulated or blended with oils, tenacious
beyond the power of fermentation to exhibit them. The
proportioning therefore the heat of the water to the dryness
of the malt, more especially to obtain from the grain
the whole strength it is capable of yielding, as well as to
cause the drink to preserve itself sound its intended time,
is of real necessity.</p>

<p>Well-brewed drinks should not only preserve themselves
sound their due space, in order to be meliorated
by time; they should likewise be fine and transparent.&mdash;These
circumstances prove the artist’s skill and care, as
well as the salubrity of the drink; and are the surest
signs of a well-formed must, and of a perfect fermentation.
If then the rules for obtaining these ends can be
deduced from the foregoing principles and experiments,
we may flatter ourselves with possessing a theory, which
will answer our expectations in practice.</p>

<p>According to the laws of nature discovered by Sir Isaac
Newton, the spaces between the parts of opaque bodies
are filled with mediums of different densities, and the
discontinuity of parts, each in themselves transparent, is
the principal cause of their opacity. Salts in powder, or
infused in an improper medium, will intercept the light;
gums make a muddy compound, when joined to spirits;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and oils, unassisted by salts, refuse to be incorporated
with water. Musts, therefore, whose constituent parts are
not capable of being dissolved by water into one homogeneous
body, are not fit, either for a perfect fermentation,
or a pellucid drink.</p>

<p>Length of time, which improves beers and wines, often
rectifies our errors in this respect; for the oils being, by
various frettings, more attenuated, and more intimately
mixed, the liquor is frequently restored, and becomes of
itself pellucid. Yet I never found this to succeed, where
the error upon the whole of the dryness of the malt, and
the heat of the extracts, exceeded the medium by 10
degrees.</p>

<p>Art has also, in some measure, concurred with nature
to remedy this defect. When beers or wines have been
suffered to stand, till they are rather in an attracting than
in a repelling state, that is, when their fermentations and
frettings apparently stand still; then, if they do not become
spontaneously fine, they may be precipitated, by
mixing with them a more ponderous fluid. The floating
particles, that occasioned the foulness, are, by this means,
made to subside to the bottom, and leave a limpid wine:
but the power of dissolved isinglass, the ingredient generally
used for this purpose, seldom takes effect, when
the error exceeds the medium, as before, by more than 10
degrees.</p>

<p>Other ingredients, indeed, have been used, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
carry this power near 10 degrees farther. It is not my
province to determine, whether such be salutary: undoubtedly
it would be better if there were no occasion for
them. Beyond these limits, precipitation has no effect;
the liquor, which cannot be fined thereby, if attempted,
by increasing the quantity of the precipitants, will be
overpowered by the menstruum, and injured in its taste.
How frequent this last case of cloudiness is, would answer
no purpose in this place to enquire. The use of doubtful
ingredients, and such errors as have been mentioned,
need no longer blemish the art, when a constant and
happy practice, will be both the effect and the proof of a
solid and experimental theory.</p>

<p>Beers which become bright of themselves, or by time
alone, as well as those precipitated either by dissolved
isinglass, or by more powerful means, each possess their
respective properties in a certain latitude or number of
degrees; and as these effects arise wholly from the heats
employed in drying the malts, and in forming the extracts,
the following table will be of use to point out the limits,
within which each drink may be obtained.</p>

<p>The difference between the heat for forming grapes,
and the greatest heat which ripened them, affords to us
the number of degrees answerable to their constituent
parts: the investigation of barley, in like manner, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
less important to our purpose, yet may, with some propriety,
be admitted.</p>

<p>Upon examination it will be found, barley ears, and
the new grain begins to form (being still in possession of
its flower) about the same time with us as grapes do, in
June; when we found the mean heat of the air in the
shade to be 57.60 degrees.</p>

<p>Barleys in general are mowed from August to September;
so that, in their growth, they are benefited
by the whole of our summer’s heat, and for like reasons
as in page 59, we estimate this 61.10 degrees: 3.50 degrees
then would be the number of their constituent
parts, taken from the degrees of heat in the shade, and
which perhaps would be different if the actual sun-shine
heat and what is reflected from the earth, were accounted
for. Barleys are annuals, unbenefited by the whole of
the autumn sun; but, after being mowed, they are
stacked, retaining still much of their straw, leaves, and
outward skins. In these heaps they heat, more or less,
according to the condition in which they were housed;
and which heat may reach to 120 degrees or more, but
in general is equal, or somewhat superior, to that of our
bodies. The properties of the grain, by this means improved,
ripen, and from hence are more capable of preserving
themselves. This might be a reason why a farther
allowance should be made to the number of degrees
denoting their constituent parts: how much, by a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
great number of observations, made from the germination,
ripening, to the stacking of the barley, in many
years, and in many cases, might probably be ascertained;
but the difficulty of doing this, and afterwards the
impossibility of complying with the information such
enquiries would afford, and the little need there is for it,
as nature has allowed a considerable latitude for our deviating
from what may be styled perfection, without
any sensible injury: these circumstances render such
enquiries unnecessary, if not fruitless.</p>

<p>Vegetables, but more particularly barley, from their
first origin to such time as they might be ultimately separated
by fire, may be divided into different periods, according
to the distinct properties belonging to each, (and each
of these require again a more exact enquiry.) Barley is
under the act of germination, so long as the acrospire or
stem is within the outward skin of the parent corn; this
excluded, it vegetates so long as it receives nourishment
by the interposition of its roots. It may be said to be in
a state of concentration, when receiving but little or no
support from the earth, yet it is acted upon by such heats
as do not exceed what it might bear in the vegetative
period; and in that of inaction, when, by the power of
heat, it is placed in a passive state. Now malt is barley
germinated, and, by a quick transition, is impressed with
heats superior to those admitted in vegetation, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
as places the corn in a state of inaction. In the beginning
of the process of malting, the more tenacious
oils, together with some salts, are excluded from the
body of the grain, to form the vessels requisite to forward
the growth of the future plant. What remains in the
parent grain (that choice food, at first necessary to the infant
barley) are saccharine salts, alone applicable to the
brewer’s purpose, and of the nature and quantity of
which, he ought to be well acquainted. To retain these,
and prevent a waste thereof, the germinated corn is
placed in such heat, as destroys the union between its
parts, from whence it becomes inactive. When this
intent is obtained by the least heat capable of effecting it,
the malt retains both its color, and the whole of its properties.</p>

<p>Vegetables, in no part of their growth, are ever affected
by heats so great as to disperse their constituent parts;
on the contrary, by natural heats, in general they are improved.
The whole of their elements then, must be measured
from the first degrees which form them, to the last
which procure their highest perfection; and in climates
where they are not benefited by the whole of such heat,
their properties must be accounted only so many degrees,
as in such places are between the extremes of their germination
and maturation. Alike with malt, their whole
number of constituent parts, denoted by degrees of heat,
must be so many as are comprehended between that de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>gree
which leaves it in possession of the whole of their
elements, and the first heat which excludes a part; for
malt more dried than this, being less perfect, and losing
some of its properties, fewer must remain.</p>

<p>The degree of heat which in malt divides the period
of germination from that of inaction, we have found to
be 119; the grain then is perfectly white, and shews little
if any sign of effervescence; the first change, fire occasions
therein, is to impress it with a light yellow color;
this takes place at 129 degrees of heat, an alteration
which can proceed from no other cause, but, in removing
its original whiteness, to have expelled some of its primitive
parts. The difference then between these two
numbers of 10, specifies, in degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale,
the number of properties constituting barley, malt.</p>

<p>It must be confessed this is establishing a principle of
the art of brewing, upon the uncertain report of our
senses, as perhaps our sight may deceive us in fixing
this change of color exactly at 129 degrees; but we
know white and black to be the two extremes of the
dryness of malt, and that the middle color between them
is brown, which being compounded of yellow and red,
these four tinges, equally divided, as we have done in the
foregoing tables, will corroborate our fixing the teint of
yellow at this degree. The table shewing the tendency
beers have to become fine, was formed from experiments
made on brewings, whose governing medium heats were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
from 134 to 148, the proportion in point of time given
by these, justifies the division between immediate pellucidity,
at 119, and that taking place at two months,
or 129 degrees. So from hence we may be satisfied,
however an absolute perfection cannot be depended
upon, yet this being the most exact division our senses
afford, it approaches so near to truth, that if any mistake
remains, it can be but trivial, compared to the latitude
of errors, fermentation and time correct. But this number,
10 degrees, denoting the quantity of fermentable
parts, must lessen in proportion as a continued, or a
greater heat deprives the grain of more properties. A
speedy spontaneous pellucidity is the effect of the
whole fermentable parts; malt affected by heat, conveyed
either through air or water, or through both, (so the
medium of these exceeds not 138 degrees,) if assisted by
the acids gained to the drink by long standing, such will
obtain transparency. Beers, then, intended to be formed
of themselves to become fine, in the calculations used to
discover their elements, so many of the members of the
constituent parts must be implied, as corresponds with
the time the beer is intended to be kept; but when
beers are made intentionally to require precipitation to
become fine, in such proportion as we purpose to impress
opacity on the drink, we must, in the calculations made
to discover the temperature of the extracts, imply only
so many of the constituent parts, as correspond to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
medium heat which will occasion this foulness. These
few observations shew the necessity of establishing this
fundamental doctrine, the use of which will obviously
appear in practice.</p>

<p>Thus does the success of this art depend on the instrument
so often mentioned, which, by indicating the expansions
caused by different heats, becomes a sure guide
in our operations. I shall now close this account, by
comparing with the principles here laid down, the defects
which we, but too often, meet in barley when
malted.</p>

<small><i>OBSERVATIONS ON DEFECTIVE MALTS.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding enquiry, some of the defects of malt
have been occasionally mentioned: but as a perfect
knowledge of the grain, especially when it has undergone
this process, is a matter of no small concern to the
brewer, I shall now bring such defects into distinct view,
both to compare them with the foregoing principles, and
that the knowledge of them may be more at hand, on
every occasion, when wanted.</p>

<p>Every different degree of heat acting on bodies causes
a different effect: and this varies also, as such heat is
more or less hastily applied. The growth of vegetables
is in general submitted to these laws: but yet I conceive
there is some difference between germination and vegetation,
which I beg leave to point out. The former
seems to be the act caused by heat and moisture, while
the plume or acrospire is still enveloped within the teguments
of the parent corn, and it is most perfectly performed
by the gentlest action, and consequently by the
least heat, that is capable of moving the different principles
in their due order. Vegetation, again, is that act
which takes place when the plant issues forth, and, being
rendered stronger by the impressions of the air, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>comes
capable of resisting its inclemencies, or the
warmth of the sun-shine. Germination is the only act
necessary for malting, the intention being solely to put
in motion the principles of the grain, and not to rear up
the embryo to a plant. Now, as this begins in barley at
the degree where the water first becomes fluid, or nearly
so, the cold season, when the thermometer shews from
about 32 to 40 degrees, would seem the most proper for
this purpose. How far its latitude may with propriety
be extended, experience alone can determine. Maltsters
continue to work so long as they think the season
permits, and leave off generally in May, when the heat
of the water extends at a medium from 50 to 55 degrees.
But the nearer they come to this medium, with the
greater disadvantage must they malt: as, by such
warmth, the vessels of the corn are much distended, the
motion of the fluids violent, and the finer parts too apt
to fly off. Thus the coarser oils gaining admittance, the
glandular parts become filled with an impure and less
delicate sulphur, which, instead of a sweet, inclines to a
bitter, taste. This is so manifest, and so universally experienced,
that, in general, brewers carefully avoid purchasing
what is termed <i>latter-made malts</i>.</p>

<p>Malt, which has not had a sufficient time to shoot, so
that its plume may have reached to the extent of the inward
skin of the barley, remains overburthened with too large
a quantity of earth and oils, which otherwise would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
been expended in the acrospire and radical vessels. All
those parts of the corn which have not been separated,
and put in motion by the act of germination, will, when
laid on the kiln to dry, harden and glutinize: no greater
part thereof will be soluble in water, than so far as the
stem or spire of the barley rises to, or very little farther,
and as much as is wanting thereof will be lost to the
strength of the drink.</p>

<p>When malt is suffered to grow too much, or until the
spire is shot through the skin of the barley, which is not
often the case, though all that is left be malt, that is, containing
salts dissoluble in water, yet as too large a portion
of oils has been expended out of the grain, such
malts cannot be fit to brew drinks for long keeping.&mdash;There
is, besides, a real loss of the substance of the corn,
occasioned by its being overgrown.</p>

<p>Malt, the germination of which has reached and been
stopped at the proper period, and has been duly worked
upon the floors, if not sufficiently dried on the kiln, even
though the fire be excited to a proper heat, retains many
watery parts. The corn, when laid together, will be apt
to germinate afresh, perhaps to heat so as to take fire;
should not this extreme be the case, at least it must grow
mouldy, and communicate an ill flavor to the drink.</p>

<p>Malt, well grown, and worked as before, but over-dried,
though with a proper degree of heat, will become
of so tenacious a nature, as to require a long time before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
it can admit of the outward impressions of the air to
relax or mellow it, that is, before it is fit to be
brewed with all the advantages it otherwise would
have; and in proportion as it has black specks on being
masticated, so much of its parts being charred is a
diminution to the strength of the liquor, besides impressing
it with a burnt or nauseous taste.</p>

<p>Malt, dried on a kiln not sufficiently heated, must require
proportionably a longer time to receive the proper effect
of the fire; the want of which will bring it into the
same state as malt not thoroughly dried.</p>

<p>If too quick or fierce a fire be employed, instead of
gently evaporating the watery parts of the corn, it torrifies
the outward skin, divides it from the body of the
grain, and so rarifies the inclosed air as to burst the vessels.
Such is called <i>blown malt</i>, and, by the internal
expansion, occupies a larger space than it ought. If
the fire be continued, it causes its constituent parts to
harden to the consistence of a varnish, or changes it
into a brittle substance, from whence the malt is said to
be steely and glassy: it dissolves but in a small proportion,
is very troublesome and dangerous in brewing,
and frequently occasions a total want of extraction; by
the brewery termed, <i>setting the grist</i>.</p>

<p>Malt, just, or but lately, taken from the kiln, remains
warm for a considerable time. Until the heap becomes
equally cool with the surrounding air, it cannot be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to be mellow, or in a fit state to be brewed: its parts
being harsh and brittle, the whole of its substance cannot
be resolved, and the proper heat of the water, which
should be applied to it for that purpose, is therefore
more difficult to be ascertained.</p>

<p>The practice of those maltsters, who sprinkle water on
malt newly removed from the kiln, to make it appear as
having been made a long space of time, or, as they say,
to <i>plump</i> it, is a deceit which cannot too much be exposed.
By this practice, the circumstance of the heat,
and harshness of the malt, is only externally, and in appearance,
removed, and the purchaser grossly imposed
on. The grain, by being moistened, occupies a greater
volume, and, if not speedily used, soon grows mouldy,
heats, and is greatly damaged.</p>

<p>The direct contrary is the case of malt which has
been made a long time: the dampness of the air has relaxed
it, and so much moisture has insinuated itself into
the grain, that some doubt must arise how much hotter
the mash should, for this reason, be. Yet, supposing no
distemper, such as being mouldy, heated, or damaged
by vermin, it is observed, malt, under this circumstance,
may more certainly be helped in brewing, than those
just abovementioned.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it appears how necessary it
is to procure malt which has been properly steeped,
germinated to its true pitch, and dried by a gentle, mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>derate
heat, so as the moisture of the corn be duly evaporated,
then cured by just so much fire as to enable it to
preserve itself a due time, without being blown or burnt.
How easy it is to regulate this process in the cistern, in
the couch, on the floors, and on the kiln, when the malster,
intends no artifice to save his excise, I need not
say; but with what certainty and ease the whole might
be carried on by the help of the thermometer, I leave
such to determine as are modest enough to think, that
the art may be brought to more accurate rules than
those of the bare report of our unassisted senses. As
such rules may easily be deduced from the principles
here laid down, I shall not be more particular in shewing
their application, as not being my immediate purpose,
nor my business as a brewer: nor have I leisure, or the
conveniency of a malt house, to make experiments of this
sort; yet with truth it may be said, that such as would
not be disappointed in their brewing, must take care
not to be deceived in their malt. This, however, being
but too frequently the case, we should constantly be on
our guard against its defects, and know how to correct
them. If it is treated in the same manner as if it
was perfect, the well-malted parts alone will be digested.
If too slack dried, it may be corrected by
an addition of heat, if over-dried, or injured by fire,
it may proportionably be helped. By applying the
thermometer to the extracts, more particularly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
first, the brewer thereby will be informed, to a sufficient
degree of exactness, of the defects he can mend, and
hardly be ever at a loss for the properest means to work
the grain to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>As far as we have proceeded in our enquiry, though
some satisfaction must arise from our being enabled to account
for the greater part of the process of brewing, yet
it may be observed, even with the assistance of the thermometer,
as yet a geometrical exactness, in many respects,
has not been attained; but nature, when the interest and
necessities of mankind are the object, apparently has supplied
our wants, and rectified our defects. In this art,
fermentation, when allowed to display itself, corrects all
our errors to a considerable latitude, though as yet, of
this act, it may be said we scarcely conceive its cause,
or properly discern its effects.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART II.<br /><br />

<small><small><small>THE</small></small></small><br /><br />
<big>PRACTICE OF BREWING.</big></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I enter upon the practical, and indeed most
important, part of this work, it will not be improper to
give a distinct, though general, view of the different
parts it is to consist of.</p>

<p>To extract from malt a liquor, which, by the help of
fermentation, may acquire the properties of wine, is the
general object of the brewer, and the rules of that art are
the subject of these sheets.</p>

<p>An art truly very simple, if, according to vulgar opinion,
it consisted in nothing else than applying warm-water
to malt, mashing these together, multiplying the
taps at discretion, boiling the extracts with a few hops,
suffering the worts to cool, adding yeast to make it ferment,
and trusting to time, cellars, and nostrums, for
its taste, brightness, and preservation!</p>

<p>A few notes and observations, such as are too often
found to be foisted under the articles of beer and brewing,
in some books of agriculture and others of cookery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
might be sufficient, were the place and constitution of the
air always the same, the materials and vessels employed
entirely similar, and lastly, the malt drinks intended for
the same use and time; but, as every one of these particulars
is liable to variations, and can be complied with,
only by the application of different determinate heats;
was the artist to submit himself to loose, vague, and erroneous
directions, like those above mentioned, they would
only serve to deceive him, and his case would be but little
mended, if he trusted to indefinite signs, and insufficient
maxims, in his deviation from them.</p>

<p>A more certain foundation has been laid down in the
first part of this treatise, and the principles there established
will, I trust, in all cases, answer our ends, provided
we make use of proper means to settle their application.
The most elegible means to effect this, must be
to follow, as near as possible, such plan, which the rational
brewer would, in every particular circumstance,
sketch to himself, before he proceeded to business. His
first attention ought to be directed not only to the actual
heat of the weather, but also to that which may be expected
in the season of the year he is in. The grinding
of his malt must be his next object, and as the difference
of the drinks greatly depends upon that of the extracts,
he cannot but chuse to have distinct ideas of what may
be expected from the amount of the heat of them. Hops,
which are added as a preservative to the extracts form too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
important a part to be employed without a sufficient
knowledge of their power. The strength of malt liquors
depending principally on their quantity or lengths, it is
necessary to ascertain the heights in the copper, to answer
what, on this account, is intended. The difference
in boiling, for different drinks or seasons; the loss of
water by evaporation; the proper division of the whole
quantity of this element employed, and, in proportion to
such division, that of the heat to be given in each part of
the process; the means to ascertain these degrees, by determining
what quantity of cold water is to be added to
that, which is at the point of ebullition, come afterwards
under his consideration. The manner and time of mashing,
the many expected incidents which must produce
some small variations between the actual and the calculated
heat of his extracts, it will be incumbent upon him
to make a proper estimation and allowance for. To dispose
of the worts in such forms and at such depths, as may
render the influence of the ambient air the easiest and
most efficacious, and then, by the addition of yeast, to
provide the drink with that internal and most powerful
agent it had lost in boiling, are the next requisites. Fermentation,
which follows, and which the brewer retards
or forwards according to his intentions, completes the
whole process; after these necessary precautions, to compare
his operations with those of the most approved prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>titioners
in his art, and to find himself able to account for
those signs and established customs, which before were
loosely described, authoritatively dictated, and never sufficiently
determined or explained, must be to him an additional
satisfaction. As precipitation is requisite in certain
cases, the common methods for effecting it should be
known, and likewise the means practised among coopers
to correct the real or imagined errors of the brewer, in
order to render the drink agreeable to the palate of the
consumers, will naturally lead him to consider what true
taste is, and by employing the means, by which it may
safely be obtained and improved, he will have done all in
his power, to answer his customers expectation, and to
secure his success.</p>

<p>This arrangement, which appears the most simple, is
that, which the reader will find observed in the following
sections. The proper illustrations of tables and examples
have not been omitted, and from the complete plans
for brewing, under two forms of the most dissimilar kind,
it will be found the rules are adapted to all circumstances,
and applicable to every purpose.</p>

<p>I must here add somewhat in justification, for publishing
what may be said to be the mysteries of an art, often
too cautiously precluded from the sight and attention of
the public; but every art and science whatever have
equally been laid open, and from such communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
received greater improvements, and become more useful
to mankind in general, and the professors of them in particular.
If attention is given to the rules and practice
here laid down, it will be found that the brewer, from the
large quantities he manufactures, from repeated experience,
from the conveniency of his utensils, and more
than all, from the interest he has to be well acquainted
with his business, is most likely to be successful, in preference
to any one else, and therefore can have no reason
to be displeased on being presented with a theory and
practice, which, far from being the sole right of the
brewery, the discovery of the principles were certainly
the property of the author and of his friends, whose names
would do his work honor if mentioned. From the application
of these principles, being convinced of their
exactness and facility in practice, he offers his labor to a
trade he esteems, with no other view than the hope he
entertains of being of some service to it and to the
public.</p>

<p>If, notwithstanding repeated endeavours, some things,
in this treatise, should appear out of their places; others,
in more than one; if redundancies, chiefly occasioned by
the natural temptation of accounting for particular appearances,
have not always been avoided; if inaccuracies
should now and then have escaped me, let it be remembered
(by the good-natured it certainly will) that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
new and intricate subjects, digressions and repetitions
are in some measure allowable, that an over-fulness is preferable
to an affected and often obscure brevity, and that
the improvement of the art, rather than the talent of
writing, must be the brewer’s merit, and was my only
aim.</p>

<small><i>OF THE HEAT OF THE AIR</i>,</small></h3>

<p class="center f06">AS IT RELATES TO THE PRACTICAL PART OF BREWING.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> and about the city of London, the most intense cold
that has been observed is 14 degrees, and the greatest
heat has made the thermometer rise, in the shade, to 89.
Within these limits are comprehended all the fermentable
degrees, and consequently those necessary for carrying
on the process of brewing. If the lowest degree proper
for fermentation be 40, and the highest 80, the medium
of these two would, at first sight, appear to be the fittest
for this purpose; but the internal motion, necessary to
carry on fermentation, excites a heat superior to the original
state of the must by 10 degrees. Hence, if 60 degrees
be the highest eligible heat a fermenting must
should arise to, 50 should be the highest for a wort to
be let down at, to begin this act; which heat can only
be obtained, when that of the air is equal thereto, so that
it denotes the highest natural heat for beers and ales to be
properly fermented. With regard to the other extreme,
or the lowest heat, however cold the air may be, as the
worts, which form both beers and ales, gain, by boiling,
a degree greatly superior to any allowed of in fermentation,
it is constantly in the artist’s power to adapt his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
worts to a proper state. The brewing season, then, may
justly be esteemed all that part of the year in which the
medium heat of the day is at or below 50 degrees: this,
in our climate, is from the beginning of October to the
middle of May, or 32 weeks; the most elegible period
of time for brewing all kinds of beers.</p>

<p>But, as many incidents often make it necessary to extend
these limits, the only time for venturing to comply
therewith is, when the medium heat of the season is at
55 degrees; by which, six weeks more may be obtained.
But, under these circumstances, the quantity of beer
brewed should be less, that the worts may cool more readily,
by being thinner spread; and, to gain more time,
the brewing is best carried on with two worts only:
taking these precautions, and beginning early in the
morning, the first wort, by laying long enough in the
coolers, will, towards evening, be brought to a heat of
55 degrees. The night, in this season of the year, being
generally colder by 10 or 12 degrees than the medium
heat of the whole 24 hours, the second worts may
be reduced to a cold of 43 degrees: the mean of 55 and
43, being 49 degrees, would be the real heat of the worts
in the ton; and with 10 degrees more, (the heat gained
by fermentation,) still it would not reach 60 degrees,
the highest fermentable heat, beers intended to preserve
themselves long should arrive to; but so near would it
be to this, and so little is the uniformity of the heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
air to be relied on, that necessity alone can justify the
practice of brewing such drinks, when the heat of the
air is so high as 55, consequently, where it exceeds this,
it should never be attempted.</p>

<p>As the extractions are made by heats far superior to
any natural ones, though the actual temperature of the
air neither adds to, nor diminishes from, their strength,
yet it is to be known for the following reason. The
proper heat given to the mash is by means of cold
added to boiling water; and cold water generally is
of no other heat than that of the air itself. Indeed,
when the cold is so intense, as to occasion a frost, and
to change water into ice, that which is then used for
brewing, being mostly drawn from deep wells, or places
where frost never, or but seldom, takes place, may be
estimated at 35 degrees, and this will be sufficiently
exact.</p>

<p>The following table shews the temperature of the air
for every season in the year, and confirms what I have
just now said concerning the season proper for brewing,
and the actual heat of the water. It was deduced from
many years’ observations, made with very accurate instruments,
at eight o’clock in the morning, the time in
which the heat is supposed to be the medium of that of
the whole day.</p>

<p>To ascertain the authority of this table, and to make it
useful to several purposes, I have carried to decimals
the mean numbers resulting from my observations.&mdash;But
such an exactness has been found, in the practice of
brewing, to be more troublesome than necessary. I
have therefore constructed another table, similar to the
former, but where the fractions are omitted, and the
whole numbers carried on from five to five. The heats
of the latter end of October, and beginning of November,
have here been set down rather higher than they
really are; as, at this time of the year, the hops fit to
brew with are old and weak, and I could not devise any
means more easy to allow for their want of strength.</p>

<p>As nothing is so inconstant as the heat of the air, we
are not to be surprised when it deviates from the progression
specified in the table. The flowing water used in
the brewery, at the coldest seasons, we have fixed at 35
degrees, and the highest heat in the air, to carry on the
process for beers brewed for long keeping, at 55 degrees.
The length proper to be drawn, or the quantity of beer
to be made from each quarter of malt being fixed, the
brewer, at any time, has it in his power to make calculations
for brewings, supposing the mean heat of the air
to be at 35, at 40, at 45, at 50 and even at any degree
of heat whatever, so as never to be unprovided for any
season. Water, being a body more dense than air, requires
some time to receive the impressions either of heat
or cold, for which reason the medium heat of the shade of
the preceding day, will most conveniently govern this
part of the process, unless some very extraordinary
change should happen in the atmosphere. This must
make the business of the artist, in this respect, very easy,
as, in the course of his practice, he will have only to correct
the little changes that occasional incidents give rise
to; and the calculations will answer all his purposes so
long as the lengths of beer to be brewed from the same
quantity of malt remain unaltered, and with very little
variation and trouble, when the coppers employed, by
being changed, are of different dimensions.</p>

<p>The best method to know the true heat of cold water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
would be to keep a very accurate and distinct thermometer,
in the liquor back; but as this, in every place,
is not to be expected, and inaccuracies must arise from a
change in the air, to prevent their consequences in practice,
we must have recourse to experience. This has
taught us that a difference of 8 degrees, between the actual
heat of the water, and that from which the brewing
was computed, will produce, in the first extract, a difference
of four degrees.</p>

<p>Most brewers’ coppers, though they vary in their dimensions,
are generally made in proportions nearly
uniform; the effect of one inch of cold water more or
less, will therefore nearly answer alike, that is, it will
alter the heat of the tap, by 4 degrees. But this will
only hold good in such cases, where the water is in the
same proportion to the volume of the grist. In brewing
brown beers, or porter, three worts are generally made;
the extracts therefore must be of different lengths from
what they are in beers brewed at two worts only. In
this case, the quantity of water for the first wort, is less
than it otherwise would be; and what must be allowed
for the first mash, to wet the malt, is so much as to occasion
the second, or piece liquor, to be proportionably
less also; as it is of great consequence, if the first tap
doth not answer to its proper degree, that the second
should be brought to such a heat, as to make up the medium
of the first and second extracts, the second, or piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
liquor, by reason of its shortness, is more conveniently,
and more exactly tempered in the little copper; and one
inch cooling in, is in this case found, both by calculation
and experience, to occasion a difference of one degree
of heat only in the mash.</p>

<p>One of the principal attentions, in forming beers and
ales of any sort whatever, is that they may come to their
most perfect state, at the time they are intended to be
used. Common small beer is required to be in order,
from one to four weeks, and as it is impossible to prejudge
the accidental variations, as to heat and cold, that
may happen in any one season of the year, it is rational
to act up to what a long experience has shown, is to be
expected, and to mix such quantity of cold water with
that, which is made to come to ebullition, as to bring
the extract to the degree fixed for each particular season,
let the heat, at the time of brewing, vary therefrom, in
any degree whatever.</p>

<p>In treating on the subject of air, in the former part of
this work, I observed the effect it had in penetrating the
parts of the malt, or in the technical term used by
brewers, in slacking it. As such is the case, when the
grain is entire and whole, it is more so when ground, and
experience teaches us, that, when malt has been about
24 hours from the mill, the dampness it has imbibed is
equal to half an inch more of cold water added to that
which is to be made to boil for the first liquor, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>duces
therefore a diminution of 4 degrees in the heat of
the tap<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p>An effect, somewhat resembling this, is caused by
the impression of the air on the utensils of a brewhouse,
which are not daily used; the heat received from a foregoing
process has expanded their pores, and rendered
them more susceptible of cold and moisture. From this
circumstance, the heat of the first mash will be affected
in a proportion equal to half an inch less cooling in, or
in the space of 24 hours, to 4 degrees of heat.</p>

<p>The time of the day, in which the first extract is made,
becomes another consideration; for as 8 o’clock in the
morning is the time of the medium heat in the whole 24
hours, the other hours will give different degrees. When
a first mash is made about 4 o’clock in the morning, the
following table shews the difference between the heat at
4 and 8; that of the other hours, in the like case, may be
learned by observation. It has been observed, that, in
the cold months, from the sun’s power being less, the
heat of the day and night are more uniform, and also
that the coldest part of the 24 hours is about half an hour,
or an hour before sun-rising. I have judged it convenient
to place, in the same table, the several incidents affecting
the first extract.</p>

<p>Before we quit this subject, it may not be improper to
observe, that, in the hottest season, and in the hottest
part of the day, the difference between the heat of the
air in the shade, and that in the sun’s beams in and about
London, is nearly 16 degrees, and also that cellars or repositories
for beers, are, in winter, generally hotter by
ten degrees, than the external air; and in summer,
colder, by five.</p>

<small><i>OF GRINDING.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Malt</span> must be ground, in order to facilitate the
action of the water on the grain, which otherwise would
be obstructed by the outward skins. Every corn should
be cut, but not reduced to a flour or meal, for, in this
state, the grist would not be easily penetrable. It is
therefore sufficient that every grain be divided into two
or three parts, nor is there any necessity for varying this,
for one sort of drink more than another. In every brewing
the intention of grinding is the same; and the transparency
of the liquor, mentioned by some on this occasion,
depends, by no means, on the cut of the corn.</p>

<p>It has been a question, whether the motion of the mill
did not communicate some heat to the malt; should this
be the case, it can be but in a very small degree; and,
what may arise from hence, will be lost by shooting the
grain out of the sacks, or uncasing the grist into the mash
ton. Of late years it has been recommended, instead of
grinding the malt, to bruise it between two iron cylinders:
if, by this means, some of the fine mealy parts are
prevented from being lost in air, it must be very inconsiderable,
and, perhaps, not equal to the disadvantage
of the water not coming in immediate contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the flour of the grain. In brewing, not all, but only a
certain portion of the constituent parts of the malt are
requisite; these, heated water alone is sufficient to procure,
so that, upon the whole, the difference between
bruising and grinding the grain can be of no great consequence.</p>

<p>We have before observed, malt, by being ground and
exposed for some time to the air, more readily imbibes
moisture than when whole, and the dampness, thus absorbed,
being in reality so much cold water, a grist, that
has been long ground, is capable of being impressed with
hotter waters than otherwise it would require. In country
places, where the quantity brewed consists only of a few
bushels of malt, and make so small a volume as to be incapable
to maintain an uniform heat, where the people
are ignorant, that a certain degree is necessary to form a
proper extract with; and where, instead of this, boiling
water is indifferently applied, the effects of these errors
are in some measure prevented, by grinding the malts a
considerable time, as a month or six weeks before the
brewing, and by the excess of fire readily escaping from
so small a quantity. This method, from the inconstant
state of the air, and from the impossibility of acting up
to rule, must be very uncertain and fortuitous, so that
few or no arguments are necessary to explode it. The
truth is, the merit of country ales, so often mentioned,
proceeds from the forbearing to use the drink, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
it is in the fittest state. Thus time not only corrects the
errors of the operators, but also gives them, in the eyes
of the consumers, the credit of an extraordinary knowledge
and unmerited ability.</p>

<small><i>OF EXTRACTION.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Fire</span> impressed on malt, either through air or water, it
is true, has similar effects as to preservation, but the fact
is not the same as to taste: the sweet, the burnt flavor,
or the proportion of both, the malt originally had, sensibly
appear in the extracts; but water heated to excess
will not, in extracting pale malt, communicate to the
worts an empyreumatic taste; whether this proceeds
from some acid parts, still residing in the heated waters,
which might help the attenuated oils to tend towards a
sweet, or from other reasons, is not easily determinable;
certain it is, the foundation of taste in malt liquors is in
the malt itself.</p>

<p>The basis of all wines is a sweet: this circumstance
for brewing beers agreeable to the palate must always be
attended to. Next to this, it is required that the liquor
should possess all the strength, it can fittingly be made
susceptible of. Pale malt, as it retains the whole virtue
of the grain, yields the strongest beers. The finest oils
being fittest for fermentation, malt dried by fierce heats,
in a great measure loses these, and what remains are not
only coarser oils, less miscible with water, but such as
bring with them the impressed taste of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>To answer the purposes of taste, strength, and preservation,
from what has been said it appears, that the extracting
water must be of a heat superior to that which
dried the malt; no other rule appears to direct in this,
than to make choice of malt of such dryness, the delicacy
of which has not been removed by fire, and such as will,
at the same time, admit of a sufficient number of superior
degrees of heat, to extract all its fermentable parts;
that is (see page 124) malt whose dryness is nearly 19
degrees less than the mean of the drying and extracting
heats applicable to the purpose intended.</p>

<p>As 119 degrees, the first heat forming pale malt, and
at which it possesses the whole of its sweetness and virtues,
may be said to be the lowest degree of dryness in
the grain to form keeping beers with, so 138 degrees,
above which the native whiteness of the grain is so subdued,
as to remain but in a very small proportion, is the
highest dried malt fit to be used for any purpose; from
these premises the following table is formed, to shew the
degree of dryness of malt, where taste and strength are
equally consulted, to brew drinks capable of keeping
themselves sound a long time, at any medium required.</p>

<p>The proper choice of malt I thought necessary to
point out, previous to entering more at large on the
subject of extraction. This table, it must be observed,
is in no wise directive for brewing common small beer,
soon to be expended, that liquor depending on many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
other circumstances, of which notice will be taken immediately

<p>The subject to be resolved having been examined as
to its dryness, we now come to the immediate matter for
which this section was intended.</p>

<p>Extraction is a solution of part, or the whole, of a
body, made by means of a menstruum. In brewing, it
is chiefly the mealy substance of the grain that is required
to be resolved; fire and water combined are sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
perform this act. Water properly is the receptacle of
the parts dissolved, and fire the power, which conveys
into it a greater or less proportion of them.</p>

<p>When all the parts necessary to form a vinous liquor
are not employed, or when more than are required for
this purpose are extracted, the liquors must vary in their
constituent parts, and consequently be different in their
effects. This difference arises either from heat alone, or
from the manner of applying it; and the properties of
beers and ales will admit of as many varieties as may be
supposed in the quantity of the heat, and in its application.
But as the useful differences are alone necessary
to the brewer, they may be reduced to the four following
modes of extraction.</p>

<p>First, that which is most perfect, and for which malt
is chose of such dryness, in which it with certainty possesses
the whole of its constituent parts, and the extracts
are made with such heats, as to give the beer an opportunity
to be improved by time, and to become of itself
fine and transparent.</p>

<p>Secondly, that from which, in order to obtain every
advantage of time, strength, and flavor, such extracts are
produced as cannot become pellucid of themselves, but
require precipitation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that which is intended soon to become intense,
where soundness and transparency are for some
short time expected, but not always obtained, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
brewed in every season of the year, and deprived of the
advantages which age and better managements procure
to the first.</p>

<p>Fourthly, that where the advantages of strength and
pellucidity are to be procured in a very short space.</p>

<p>These four modes of resolving the grain, being the
fundamental elements on which almost every specie of
drink is brewed, I must observe, the two first may be
said to be an exact imitation of natural wines, in forming
which, the principles we have laid down may fully be
applied. The third is the effect of necessity, by which
we are deprived of that time nature directs for properly
producing fermented liquors, and where we are subjected
to many disadvantageous circumstances; to guard
against the consequences of which, we must rely, in some
measure, upon opinion formed from observation alone;
and the fourth may be said to be art too precipitately
carried on. Before I treat of them separately, it is requisite
to mention a few general rules applicable to all.</p>

<p>In the enquiry we made of the means which nature
employs to form the juices of grapes, we found two remarkable
circumstances: the first, a necessary lesser heat
for the production of the fruit, and the second, a much
greater for its maturation; the former useful to incline
the must to fermentation, the latter to raise therein such
oils as should maintain it for some time in a sound state.
But in all wines, an evenness of taste is requisite to affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the palate with an elegant sensation; and it may be observed,
the autumn and spring heats being nearly equal;
so the first juices of grapes are formed by almost, uniform
impressions; the summer heats, though stronger,
act upon the same principle; for though the grapes remain
upon the vine some part of the autumn, perhaps in
this space they gain little more than the juices prepared
by the summer’s sun: from whence the tastes of wine are
more simple than otherwise they would be. Thus are
we directed, that a first wort shall have the least share
of heat of the whole brewing, and the last wort the
greatest; intermediate worts; if any; must be proportioned
to both, and if several mashes of extracts are made
to compose a wort, these must be equal as to their heat,
being careful at the same time to preserve to the process
the medium heat which is to govern the whole. By this
means, we shall obtain our intended purpose; and place
into the drink one and the same smooth taste.</p>

<p>In the table<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> shewing the different effects produced in
the grain by the different degrees of heat, the numbers,
with respect to beers, express, not only the mean of the
degrees of dryness the malt had, with those also of heat
in the extracting liquors, but also is implied the power
communicated by the hops, that is, it imparts to us, the
idea of the whole combination.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>
<p>As malt liquors are made with different views, so must
the principles on which they are formed be varied.
Beers intended long to be kept, require more heat in their
extracts, in order to produce such oils, or so many in
quantity from the grain, as shall retard and delay the
quick effects of fermentation; and malt liquors, which are
soon to be brought into use, claim an opposite management.
This is imitating nature, for we have before observed<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>,
the hotter the autumnal, the vernal and maturating
heats are, with more power do the wines resist the
impressions of time and the air; and we traced the rule
which governed this variety, by an enquiry into the number
of degrees required to form the juices of grapes, and
applied their number to discover the first and last heats
they were impressed with. In calculations to find out
the heat to be given to water properly to resolve the malt,
the same method must be followed, it being equally necessary
here to employ only such a proportion of the
number of degrees which constitute the whole of the fermentable
principles in malt that are needful to the purpose
we would answer. We have said malts continue in
possession of all their constituent parts from their first
degree of dryness, 119 to 129. By age alone beers obtain
spontaneous pellucidity, when urged in the whole of
their process with a heat so great as 138 degrees, preci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>pitation
or art extends it to near 157 degrees, after
which neither the acid parts furnished by the air, nor
art avails: an obstinate foulness is the result; from
whence it may be concluded, that at or beyond this heat,
so great a part of the fermentable principles is dispersed,
as what remains in the grain has not power sufficient to
produce transparency. The following table, founded on
these principles, will hereafter be found directive to fix
the first and last heats to be given to the extracts of
malt.</p>

<p>Though beers and ales are divided into strong and
small, this division regards only the proportion of the
vehicle, and not that of the constituent parts. The same
means, as to the heat of the extracts, must be employed,
to form small beers, capable of preserving themselves
sound for some time, as are used to make strong drinks:
for though a small liquor possesses more aqueous parts,
the oils and salts of the malt are only more diluted, not
altered in their proportions, and this causes but a very
small difference in the duration of the liquor.</p>

<p>It now remains to apply these rules, deduced from the
theory, to the several sorts of malt liquors, which answer
to the four modes of extraction, just before laid down.</p>

<p>The first and most perfect is, when the malt is chosen
of such dryness, and the extracts made with such heats,
as give the beers an opportunity of being improved by
time, and slow fermentations, to become spontaneously
bright and transparent. Under this head, may be comprehended
all <i>pale keeping strong</i>, and all <i>pale keeping
small</i> beers.</p>

<p>From its name, regard must be had to the color of the
malt, and such only used, as is dried the least, or by
119<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> degrees of heat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>
<p>The hops should likewise be pale, and their quantity
used in proportion to the time the drink is intended to
be kept; suppose, in this case, it is 10 months, 10lb. of
fine hops, for every quarter of malt, will be required.</p>

<p>The highest degree of heat, or rather the medium of
the highest dryness in malt, with the mean heat of the
several extractions, to admit of spontaneous pellucidity,
we have seen in the foregoing table (page 124) to be
138 degrees, and this medium is chosen, as it answers
not only the intent of long keeping, but of brightness
also.</p>

<p>From the medium degree of the malt’s dryness, and of
the heat of the extracts, to determine the heat of the first
and the last extract, and the value in degrees of the
quantity of hops to be used, for brewing pale strong and
pale small beers, intended to be kept about ten months
before they are used, and expected to become self-transparent.</p>

<p>It is necessary to add 2 degrees to the heat of every
mash, such being the mean of 4 degrees, constantly lost
in every extract, at the time they are separated from the
grist, and exposed to the impressions of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>The second mode of extraction is, that, in which every
advantage which can be procured from the corn, from
art, and from time is expected; this produces such
drinks, as cannot become spontaneously pellucid, but require
the help of precipitation.</p>

<p>The improvement, which every fermented liquor gains
by long standing, is very considerable; the parts of the
grain, which give spirit to the wine, being, by repeated
fermentations, constantly attenuated, not only become
more light and pungent, but more wholesome. If, in
order to give to beers more of the preservative quality,
greater quantities of oils are extracted, in proportion to
the salts, transparency cannot take place; but, when the
heat employed for this purpose does not exceed certain
limits, this defect may easily be remedied, and the drink
be fined by precipitation; as time enables it to take up
part of the very oils, which at first prevented its transparency,
it will, by long standing, and by precipitation, become
both brighter and stronger.</p>

<p>Where the demand for a liquor is constant and considerable,
but the quantity required not absolutely certain,
it ought to be brewed in such manner that time may increase
its merit, and precipitation render it almost immediately
ready for use. These circumstances distinguish
this class of extraction, and justify the preference given
to <i>porter</i> or <i>brown</i> beer, which comes under the mode we
are now treating of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>Though transparency in beers is a sure sign of the
salts and oils being in an exact proportion, it is in no
wise a proof of the justness of taste: for strong salts acting
on strong oils may produce pellucidity, but the delicacy
and pungency of taste, depend on the finer oils and
the choicest salts being wholly preserved, these best admitting
of fermentation, and most perfectly becoming
miscible with the liquor, the more volatile oils and salts
of the grain if excluded, by the malt being too high
dried, the consequence in the beer must be, an heavy
and rancid taste. The less dried the malts are, which
are brewed for beers to be long kept, the hotter are the
extracts required to be, but this greater heat being communicated
to the grain through water, an element eight
hundred times more dense than air, the finer parts of the
corn, though acted upon by an heat which in air would
disperse them, by this means are retained.</p>

<p>It appears, by the table (page 124) that drinks brewed
from malts, affected by heats, whose medium is 148
degrees, and with twelve pounds of hops to every quarter
of malt, require from 6 to 12 months with precipitation
to become bright; this is the age generally appointed
for brown beers to be drank at, and by the table, page
133, we find the proper malts where the medium heat of
the whole process is 148 degrees, must be such as have
been dried with 130 degrees to form this liquor, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
color as yet is expected to be full or brown, without being
deprived of more valuable qualifications.</p>

<p>In the drink before examined, the number of degrees
which constitute the properties of malt, affected by a mean
heat of 138 or 7 degrees, were employed, they being intended
to become, in time, spontaneously bright; but,
as this quality in the present case is required only with
the assistance of precipitation, the number 5, in the table,
shewing the constituent parts remaining in the grain at
every degree of dryness, (page 168) as this corresponds
to the medium 148, is undoubtedly that which must answer
our purpose, both as to the nature and to the time
this liquor is in general made use of. These conditions
being premised, the proper degrees of the first and last
extract for porter will be found by the same rules as were
used before.</p>

<p>Brown beers, brewed with malt so low dried as 130
degrees, twenty years since, would have appeared very
extraordinary, and most likely, at that time, when a heaviness
and blackness in the drink formed its principal
merit, would have been a sufficient reason to condemn
the practice; but strength and elegance being now more
attended to, have justified the brewer, in making porter,
to employ malt of such degree of dryness, as he shall
think will best answer these purposes.</p>

<p>As high liquors used to extract low dried malt will
form a must capable to preserve itself equally a long time,
as an adequate liquor used to high dried malt doth; and
the first of these methods having greatly the advantage
of the other in point of taste, as 130 degrees of dryness in
malt is one, from its change of color, where part of its
finer principles may be supposed to be evaporated. It
may not be amiss to enquire if there be not reasons why
malt, less affected by fire, should be used for manufacturing
this commodity.</p>

<p>Whether any attempt to improve this liquor, by using
malt of less dryness than 125 degrees, may ever be put
in practice, is very uncertain; porter, if brewed with
malts so low as 119 degrees, probably would succeed;
for, in this case, the last mash, according to the foregoing
rules, would be at the 174th degree, at which the
spirit of the grain could not be dispersed, and probably
the result would be, a more delicate, more strong, and
more vinous liquor.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that 4 degrees are charged for the
quantity of hops used; as this number corresponds to the
quantity proper to form beer of this denomination. A
greater or a less proportion of hops is sometimes allowed
to this drink, on account of its better, or inferior quality,
of the necessity there may be to render it fit for use
in a shorter time than that which is commonly allowed&mdash;from
nine to twelve months, and, lastly, of old, stale,
or otherwise defective drinks, blended, with new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
guiles. In these cases, which cannot be too rare, the
errors should be corrected only by the addition of hops,
and no alteration be made, either in the dryness of the
malts, or in the heat of the extracts.</p>

<p>The third mode of extraction is that which intends
spontaneous transparency, but not a durable liquor.
Under this head is comprehended <i>common small beer</i>,
soon to be drank.</p>

<p>Common small beer is supposed to be ready for use,
in winter, from two to six weeks, and in the heat of summer,
from one week to three. Its strength is regulated
by the different prices of malt and of hops; its chief intent
is to quench thirst, and its most essential properties
are, that in the winter it should be fine, and in the summer
sound. This liquor is chiefly used in and about
great trading cities, such as London, where, for want of
a sufficient quantity of cellar room, drinks cannot be
stowed, which, by long and slow fermentations, would
come to a greater degree of perfection. The duration
of this kind of liquor being short, and there being a necessity
of brewing it in every season of the year, dividing
it into very small quantities, easily affected in its conveyance
by the external heat: generally neglected, and
placed in repositories influenced by every change of air,
the incidents attending it, and the methods for carrying
on the process must be more uncertain, various, and complicated,
than those of any other liquor made from malt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>The incidents attending this specie of malt liquor are
so many, so short of existence, so contrary to one another,
and often so different from what should be expected
in the different periods of the year, that an attempt to
guard, in a just proportion, against every one of them,
and against what <i>may</i> happen, and oftentimes does not,
must be fruitless. After many endeavours of this sort,
which terminated in a doubtful success, we have found it
most eligible to form these drinks in proportion to the
principal circumstances constantly attending them, and
the result was more fortunate, as, in general, the drink
was able to maintain itself against that variety of temperature
it met with in the places allotted to it.</p>

<p>In proportion as it is brewed, in a hot or in a cold season,
we must employ every means, either to repel or to
attract the acids circulating in the air; for this purpose,
the degree of dryness in the malt, the quantity of hops,
the heat of the extracts, and the degree of temperature
the wort is suffered to ferment with, must vary as such
seasons do. The success, in brewing common small beer,
greatly depends on its fermentation being retarded or accelerated,
in proportion to the heat of the air, and expansion
being the principal effect of heat, was a wort of
this sort suffered, in winter, to be so cold as 40 degrees,
the air would, with difficulty, if at all, penetrate the
must, or put it in action. This slow fermentation would
not permit the beer to be ready at the time required.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
For these reasons, brewers let down their worts, in that
season, at 60 degrees, whereas, in summer, the air of
the night is made use of to get them as cold as possible,
by which means a part of them may be 12 degrees
colder than the medium of the heat of the day, and
the whole of the worts nearly 5 degrees, in the space of
24 hours.</p>

<p>The choice of the malt, as to its dryness and color, for
brewing this liquor, should be varied in proportion to the
several seasons, but custom requires it should be kept
nearly to an uniform color. For this reason, when the
air is so cold as the lowest fermentable degree, a greater
dryness than 119 degrees is required; but the dryness of
malt forming only one part of the process, the proper
medium directing the whole must be brought to its true
degree, by the heat given to the extracts. In the height of
summer, malt dried to 130 degrees seems to be the best,
as it unites the properties of speedy readiness, preservation,
and transparency, and these several characters are,
at that time, requisite in this liquor.</p>

<p>To come as near as possible to the inclination of the
consumers, or to maintain as near as may be an uniform
color, if in the hottest season malt dried to 130 is best
for this purpose, the mean between this and 119, the first
degree that constitutes malt, must answer nearest every
intent, when the heat of the air is at 40 degrees. Upon
this footing, the following table will, from the proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
of these two extremes, shew the color of the grain for
every season of the year.</p>

<p>If common small beer was immediately to be used
after being brewed and fermented, and it was free from
the incidents, most of which we have just now enumerated,
no hops would be required, and the medium degree
of the whole process would be that of the lowest
dried malt, 119, to be employed when the heat of the air
was at its first fermentable degree, or 40, as, with adequate
malts, this would make the liquor that would be ready
in the least space, and, at the same time, yield its constituent
parts; but if small beer was intended to be kept
some short time, brewed without hops, and not liable to
any accidents, and the process to be carried through, in a
heat of air equal to the highest fermentable degree, or
80, in this case the governing medium for the whole
process must be the utmost heat the grain is able to endure,
where malt charrs, or 175 degrees. As malt li<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>quors

<p>Now the principal heats affecting common small beer,
with regard to its duration, are the degree of heat under
which the beer is at first fermented, that of the air when
brewed, and when conveyed from place to place, and
that of the cellar where it is deposited; let us, in regard
to these heats, take the mean of the circumstances this
drink is liable to, at the time when the air is at the first
fermentable degree, and at the time when the season is
hottest (taking for this the medium heat of the whole 24
hours.) Having these two extremes, and making a fit

<p>From due observation of this table, it appears, how
necessary it is for brewers to be acquainted, not only
with the daily temperature of the air, but also with the
medium heat of such spaces of time, wherein a drink
like this is expected to preserve itself. This I have estimated
for every 14 days; (page 150) but as the event may
not always exactly correspond with our expectations, an
absolute perfection in this drink, as to its transparency
and soundness, is not to be expected. It greatly depends
on the care and attention given to it, and on the temperature
and quiescent state of the cellars it is placed in.
The first of these circumstances is often neglected, and
the other hardly ever obtained, as the places, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
common small beer is kept, are generally the worst of
the kind.</p>

<p>In keeping beers, every circumstance is assistant to
form them so as to obtain elegance in taste, strength, and
pellucidity, either spontaneously or by precipitation, but
in common small beer; from the shortness of its duration;
and from the many complicated incidents that occur;
only the medium of the effect of these can be attended
to; which governing medium, in general, differs so much
from those which form more exact fermentable proportions,
that in these extracts, there cannot be expected
that near resemblance to natural wines, which, under
more favorable management, it is capable of.</p>

<p>The fourth mode of extraction is that, which, by conveying
a heat, equal to what is practised for keeping
pale strong, and keeping pale small beers, to the liquors
commonly known by the names of <i>pale ale</i>, <i>amber</i>, or
<i>twopenny</i>, the softest and richest taste malt can possibly
yield, and which makes them resemble wines formed
from grapes ripened by the hottest sun, though by artfully
exciting periodical fermentations, they are, in a
very short time, made to become transparent.</p>

<p>As wines have, in general, been named from the town
or city, in the neighbourhood of which the grapes, from
which they are made, are found growing, this has,
though with less reason, been the case, with our numerous
class of soft beers and ales. These topical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
denominations can indeed constitute no real, at least no
considerable difference, since the birth-place of any
drink is the least of all distinctions, where the method of
practice, the materials employed, and the heat of the climate,
are nearly the same.</p>

<p>Ales are not required to keep a long time; so the hops
bestowed on them, though they should always be of the
finest color, and best quality, are proportionably fewer
in the winter than in the summer. The reason is, that
the consumption made of this liquor in cold weather, is
generally for purl<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, whereas, in summer, as it is longer
on draught, it requires a more preservative quality.</p>

<p>The properties of this liquor are, that it should be
pale; its strength and taste principally depend on the
malt, and its transparency should be the effect of fermentation,
accelerated by every means, which will not
be hurtful to it. Malt capable of yielding the strongest
extracts, is such whose dryness does not exceed 120
degrees; and 138 we have seen to be the highest mean
of the extracts, and of the dryness of the malt to admit of
pellucidity, without precipitation; the hops used, being
only so many as are necessary to resist the heat of the
seasons the ale is brewed in, may in general be estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>in value, one degree; from these premises, the elements
for brewing this drink, will be found by the same rules
as before, where 10 degrees are supposed to be equal to
the whole of the constituent parts, and the whole of these
are employed to accelerate its coming to perfection.</p>

In and about London, and in some counties in
England, these ales, by periodical fermentations, are
made to become fine, sooner than naturally they would
do, and often, in a shorter time than one week. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
means of doing this, by beating the yeast into the drink,
as it is termed, has by some been greatly blamed, and
thought to be an ill practice. An opinion that the yeast
dissolved in the drink, and thereby made it unwholesome,
prevailed; and some brewers, erroneously led by this,
and yet willing that their commodity should appear of
equal strength with such as had undergone repeated fermentations,
have been induced to add ingredients to their
worts, if not of the most destructive nature, at least very
unwholesome. The plain truth is, that, by returning the
elastic air in the fermenting ale, the effects of long keeping
are greatly imitated, though with less advantage as
to flavor and to strength; but as this case relates to
fermentation, we shall have hereafter an opportunity of
explaining it more at large.</p>

<p>It is under this class, that the famous <i>Burton ale</i> may
be ranked, and, if I do not mistake, it will be found, that
its qualities and intrinsic value will be the same, when
judiciously brewed in London, or elsewhere, from
whence it may be exported at much cheaper rates to
Russia and other parts, than when it is increased in
price by a long and chargeable land-carriage.</p>

<p>When drinks are made so strong as these generally
are, only two mashes can take place, by which the whole
virtue of the malt not being expended, small beer is
made after these ales. The purest and most essential
parts of the grain being extracted, it is not to be expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>ed,
from an impoverished grist, that beers can be made
to possess all their necessary constituent parts, or to keep
so long, as where fresh malt is used; but the sort of small
beer, which answers best to the brewer, and is most salubrious
for the consumer, must be, by the addition of
fresh hops, to form the remaining strength into keeping
small beer, the greater quantity of hops necessary to be
allowed, beside those boiled in the ale, is 2¼ pounds for
every barrel intended to be made. As much more water
must be employed, for this small beer, besides its length,
as will steam away in two hours boiling, and 1/8 of a barrel
per quarter of malt, for waste. The heat regulating
the extract of small, will be found by the following
rule.</p>

<p>All the hops after these two brewings, as those added
for the keeping small beer have been boiled but in one
wort, are in value, for the next guile of beer, equal to
1/10 of fresh hops.</p>

<p>We should now put an end to this section, but, as
other drinks are brewed besides those here particularly
treated of, we shall just mention them, to shew how
their different processes are reducible to the rules just
laid down.</p>

<p><i>Brown</i> ale is a liquor, whose length is generally two barrels
from one quarter of malt, and which is not intended
for preservation. It is heavy, thick, foggy, and therefore
justly grown in disuse. The hops used in this, differ
in proportion to the heats of the season it is brewed
in, but are generally nearly half the quantity of what is
employed, at the same times, for common small beer.
The system it ought to be brewed upon is not different
from that of this last liquor; the medium of the malt’s
dryness, and heat of the extracts, are the same for each
degree of heat in the air, and it requires the same management
when under fermentation. But though com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>mon pale small beer
and brown ale are so much alike in
their theory, yet, from the difference of the dryness of
the malt, which, for brown ale, is constantly so high as
130 degrees, the practice will appear greatly different.
Small beer is made after this ale, by the same rules as
that made after pale ale or amber; the malt must, in that
case, be valued according to its original dryness, and
the medium governing the process be the same as for
small beer, and as if no extract had been taken from the
grain. No small beer brewed after ales can ever be
equal in goodness to such as are brewed from entire
grists; but that which is made after brown ale, from the
grain being so highly dried, and nearly exhausted, is
neither nourishing or fit to quench thirst.</p>

<p><i>Brown stout</i> is brewed with brown malt, as amber is
with pale; the system for brewing these liquors is the
same, allowing for the difference in the dryness of the
malt. The overstrength of this drink has been the reason
of its being discontinued, especially since porter or
brown beer has been brought to a greater perfection.&mdash;That
which is brewed with an intent of being long kept,
should be hopped in proportion to the time proposed, or
the climate it is to be conveyed to.</p>

<p><i>Old hock</i> requires the same proportion of hops as are
used in keeping pale strong, or keeping pale small beer;
but more or less, according to the time it is intended to
be kept before it becomes fit for use. The length is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
about two barrels, from a quarter of the palest and
best malt. As spontaneous pellucidity is required, its
whole medium must not exceed 138 degrees, for the drying
and extracting heat. The management of it, when
fermenting, is under the same rules with keeping small
beer, or those which are allowed a due time to become
of themselves pellucid.</p>

<p><i>Dorchester beers</i>, both strong and small, range under
the same head. They are brewed from barleys well
germinated, but not dried to the denomination of malt.
The rule of the whole 138 degrees for the governing
medium, must, even with this grain, be observed to form
these drinks; but, from the slackness of the malt, and the
quantities of salt and wheaten flour mixed with the liquor,
when under fermentation, proceed its peculiar taste, its
mantling, and its frothy property.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SECTION IV.<br /><br />

<small><i>OF THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES
OF HOPS.</i></small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> constituent parts of malt, like those of all vegetable
sweets, are so inclined to fermentation, that, when
once put in motion, it is difficult to retard their progress,
retain their preservative qualities, and prevent
their becoming acid. Among the many means put in
practice, to check this forwardness of the malt, none
promised so much success as blending with the extracts,
the juices of such vegetables as, of themselves, are not
easily brought to fermentation. Hops were selected for
this purpose, and experience has confirmed their wholesomeness
and efficacy.</p>

<p>Hops are an aromatic, grateful bitter, endued with an
austere and astringent quality, and guarded by a strong
resinous oil. The aromatic parts are volatile, and disengage
themselves from the plant with a small heat. To
preserve them, in the processes of brewing, the hops
should be put into the copper as soon as possible, and be
thoroughly wetted with the first extract, while the heat
of the wort is at the least, and the fire under the copper
has little or no effect thereon. Whoever will be at the
trouble to see this performed, by the means of rakes, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
otherwise, will be made sensible, that flavor is retained,
which, when the wort comes to boil, is otherwise constantly
dissipated in the air.</p>

<p>The bitter is of a middle nature, or semivolatile: it
requires more fire to extract it, than the aromatic part,
but not so much as the austere or astringent. Hence it
is plain, that the principal virtues of this plant are best
obtained by decoction, the austere parts not exhibiting
themselves, but when urged by so violent and long continued
boiling, as is seldom, or never practised in the
brewery. It would be greatly satisfactory to fix, from
experiments, the degrees of heat, that first disperse the
aromatic, next the bitter, and lastly the austere parts;
as it is likely, by this means, a more easy and certain
method of judging of the true value and condition of
hops, than any yet known, might be discovered.</p>

<p>This vegetable is so far from being, by itself, capable
of a regular and perfect fermentation, that, on the contrary,
its resinous parts retard the aptness which malt
has to this act. Hops, from hence, keep barley-wines
sound a longer space of time, and, by repeated and slow
frettings, give an opportunity to the particles of the
liquor to be more separated and comminuted. Fermented
liquors acquire, by this means, a greater pungency,
even though it was admitted they received no
additional strength from this mixture, the direct contrary
of which might easily be made to appear. Hops, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
are not only the occasion of an improvement of taste,
but an increase of strength.</p>

<p>Dr. Grew seems to think the bitter of the hops may
be increased by a greater degree of dryness; but, perhaps,
this is only one of the means of their retaining
longer this quality, which undoubtedly decreases through
age, in a proportion, as near as can be guessed, of from
10 to 15 per cent. yearly.</p>

<p>The varieties of the soils in which hops are planted,
may have some share in the inequality we perceive in
them. They seem to be much benefited by the sea air.
Whoever will try similar processes with the<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Worcestershire
and Kentish hops, will soon perceive the difference,
and the general opinion strengthens this assertion, as the
county of Kent alone produces nearly half the quantity
of hops used in this kingdom.</p>

<p>The sooner and the tighter hops are strained, after
having been bagged, the better will they preserve themselves.
The opinion that they increase in weight, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>not strained until after Christmas, may be true, but will
not recommend the practice; the hops imbibe the moisture
of the winter air, which, when the weather grows
drier, is lost again, together with some of the more spiritous
parts. Nor is this the greatest damage occasioned
by this delay, as hops, by being kept slack bagged in
a damp season, too often become mouldy.</p>

<p>Hops may be divided into ordinary and strong, and
into old and new. The denomination of old is first given
to them, one year after they have been bagged. New
ordinary hops, when of equal dryness, are supposed to be
nearly alike in quality, with old strong ones.</p>

<p>The different teints, with which hops are affected from
the fire of the kiln, afford in brewing the best rule for
adapting their color to that of the malt; in general the
finest hops are the least, but the most carefully, dried.</p>

<p>To extract the resinous parts of the hops, it is necessary
they should be boiled. The method of disposing
them is generally to put the whole quantity, in the first
wort, which, being always made with waters less hot
than the succeeding extracts, possesses the greatest share
of acids, and is in want of the largest proportion of resins
and bitters to defend it. The virtue of the hops is
not entirely lost by once boiling, there remains still
enough to bitter and preserve the second wort. But
where the first wort is short of itself, and a large
quantity of hops are required for the whole, it is need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>less
and wasteful to put more in at once than it can absorb,
the overplus of which appears by a thin bitter pellicle
floating on the wort when laid to cool in the backs.
No particular rules can be given to avoid this inconveniency,
as the nature and quantity of the worts on one
side, and the strength of the hops on the other, must occasion
a difference in the management, easily determinable
by experience.</p>

<p>When waters, not sufficiently hot, have been used,
the wort, for want of the proper quantity of oils, readily
admits of the external impressions of the air, and is easily
excited to a strong and tumultuous fermentation,
which disperses the bitter particles, and diminishes the
effects of the hops. The virtue of this plant is therefore
retained in the drinks, in proportion to the heat of the
extracts, and the slowness of the fermentation.</p>

<p>But beers being a composition of malt, hops, and
water, united by heat, and the properties of this combination
being judged of by the medium of the whole
number of degrees of fire made use of in the process, as
we brought the virtues of malt to this denomination, it is
also essential to reduce those of hops. After many tedious
calculations and experiments, made with this view,
and unnecessary here to mention, we were obliged to
have recourse to a more simple and probable hypothesis,
and confirm the truth thereof by repeated experiments,
the relation of which, as it becomes here necessary, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
shew the necessity we were under to take a general view
of the whole process before we attempted to ascertain
this point.</p>

<p>In the table shewing the mean heat of the air applicable
to practice, the greatest cold is 35 degrees, and in
this season we observed, (page 156) the repositories of
beers were more warm than this by 10 degrees, which
makes the greatest cold of cellars to be 45 degrees; in
the same table the highest heat is 60, when cellars are 5
degrees colder than the external airs, the utmost difference
then in the temperature of cellars is 10 degrees,
and this takes place in 6 months, so that the whole variety
of heat beers deposited for keeping undergo in one
twelvemonth is 20 degrees.</p>

<p>There is no specie of beer, in brewing of which it is
requisite the artist should be more attentive to alter his
process in proportion to the change of heat in the air,
than common small beer, which, though brewed in every
season, is constantly expected to be in an uniform order
for use. In the preceding section, in the table directing
this variety, we find a difference of five degrees of heat
in the air, requires an alteration in medium heat of the
whole process of 3 degrees, and as it is from the mean
heat of the dryness of the malt, of the heat of the extracts,
and of the value of hops in degrees, that we are to
discover the quantity of fire to be given to the extracts,
this can be done only by deducting from such medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
so much as it is affected by the properties of the hops.
Just before we have seen, that the whole of the variety
of heat beers deposited in cellars to keep twelve months
undergo, amounts to 20 degrees, these, in a proportion of
5 to 3, would be 12, without being scrupulously exact.
Hops, with regard to their proportion in the whole process,
must be admitted to be one third part thereof, and,
in this case, of the proportion, 12, now found, only 4
degrees would be what they contribute towards preserving
the drink 12 months: the quantity of hops necessary
to maintain beers in a sound state this space of time, we
have found to be twelve pounds; this quantity then is
equal to 4 degrees of the medium heat of the whole
process. On these grounds we repeatedly tried the experiment
in a variety of brewings made for different purposes,
and never found any inconveniencies from the estimating
hops in such like proportion.</p>

<p>Hops should be used in proportion to the time the
liquors are intended to be kept, and to the heat of the
air in which they are fermented. The quantity requisite
to preserve beers twelve months, experience has
shewn to be<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>twelve pounds, of a good quality, joined
to one quarter of malt, and when the heat of the air is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>at 40 degrees, three pounds to every quarter has been
found sufficient to preserve drinks from four to six weeks,
as six pounds are to keep them the same term when the
thermometer is so high as 60 degrees. From these facts,
founded on informations obtained from long practice,
we shall hereafter ascertain the proper quantities to
be used in all cases.</p>

for the government of this art, the construction as
well as utility of the following tables will be obvious.</p>

<p>Amber is a liquor which, by repeated periodical fermentations,
is so attenuated, as to be soon fit for use,
and, by its strength, is supposed to resist the impressions
of the air longer than common small beer, especially
in winter; for this reason, it wants fewer hops than that
drink does, and in the summer both require equal quantities,
on account of the fermentation of amber being
carried to a greater degree.</p>

<p>The hops once boiled in amber, but used afterwards
for small beer, may be estimated equal to one fourth of
their original quality.</p>

<p>When twelve shilling small beer is made after amber,
the quality of the hops used should at least be equal in
value to the quantity of ten pounds fresh hops to every
five barrels of beer, when brewed from entire grists of
malt for this purpose.</p>

<p>Besides the use of hops for keeping the musts of malt,
they may also, with great propriety, be employed both
to strengthen and preserve sound the extracts. One or
two pounds, in a net suspended in the water the mash is
to be formed with, are sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<p>Though the purchasing the materials, used in manufacture,
does not immediately relate to its practical part,
yet as, in this case, it is of great importance to the brewer
to know what stock it is prudent for him to keep, of
an ingredient equally necessary and variable in its value,
I hope the attempt of a calculation on this subject, will
easily be pardoned.</p>

<p>The amount of the duty upon hops, for sixteen years,
from 1748 to 1765, was £.1,171,227, which sum, estimating
the duty at 21<i>s.</i> per bag, gives 1,115,454 bags,
used in that time. At the beginning and expiration of
this interval, hops sold at such high prices, as no considerable
stock can be supposed to have remained in
hand, viz. from £.8 to £.10 per hundred. If, therefore,
to the aforesaid quantity of 1,115,454 bags, which
may be supposed to have served for the whole consumption
during this period, we add what may have escaped
paying duty<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>, the annual consumption of hops may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>estimated at 70,000 bags, including what is exported to
Ireland or elsewhere. From these premises, the following
table was constructed, which, though not capable of
absolute certainty, may be of some service to the brewers,
in informing them of the quantities, that probably
remain in hand at any time, and the stock which prudence
will suggest to them to lay in.</p>

<p>This chapter should not be dismissed without reminding
the brewery, of the gross imposition they submit to
in purchasing hops. The tare which justice requires to
be allowed in the sale of all packed merchandize, by the
hop-factors is refused, who exact payment for the bagging,
at the same price as for the commodity itself. If
the consumption of hops, in England, is yearly 172,268
cwt. and these be packed one half in bags and the other
half in pockets, taking the mean price of hops to be
3l. 14s. per cwt. in this case the consumers are defrauded
at least of 39,834l. per annum; that, on a just regulation
of this matter, the commodity itself would rise in
price, there is not the least foundation for. The present
practice of monopolizing hops, by much too frequent, is
a farther reason to induce the brewery to exert the influence
they ought to have with superior power, to obtain
a right so justly due to them.</p>

<small><i>OF THE LENGTHS NECESSARY TO FORM MALT-LIQUORS
OF THE SEVERAL DENOMINATIONS.</i></small></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap f13">By</span> length, in the brewery, is understood the quantity
of drink made from one quarter of malt. Beers and ales
differ in this respect; and the particular strength allowed
to every sort of drink, varies also somewhat, according
to the prices of the materials. This increase or
abatement is, however, never such as to make the profits
certain or uniform; for the value of the grain being
sometimes double of what it is at other times, a proportionable
diminution in strength, can by no means take
place.</p>

<p>It might be expected to find here tables determining
the differences in strength and quality of each drink, in
proportion to their prices, and the expences of the brewer.
But this, for many reasons, would be inconvenient,
and in some respects impracticable. He, who chuses to
be at this trouble, ought not only to take into the account,
the prices of malt and hops, but the hazards in
the manufacturing them, those of leakage, of bad cellars,
and of careless management, the frequent returns, attended
with many losses, the wearing out of utensils, and es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>pecially
of casks, which last article, engrosses at least one
fifth of the brewer’s capital, the charges of servants,
horses, and carriages, for the delivery of the drinks, the
duties paid immediately to the government, without any
security for the reimbursement, the large stock and
credit necessary to carry on this trade, and many other
incidents, hardly to be estimated with a sufficient accuracy,
and never alike to every brewer. In general it appears,
when malt and hops are sold at mean prices, the
value of what is employed of these, is equal to the charge
attending the manufacture, or of about half the value of
the drinks. Hence this conclusion, sensibly felt by every
honest trader, that, from change of circumstances, the
reputation of the profits has outlived the reality of
them, and that a trade, perhaps the most useful to the
landed interest, to the government, and to the public, of
any, seems distinguished from all, by greater hazards,
and less encouragement.</p>

<p>But, in a treatise like this, where only the rules upon
which true brewing is founded, are laid down, I would
avoid any thing that might, though undesignedly, give
handle to invidious reflections, and ill-timed controversies.
I therefore content myself with setting down the latitudes
of the lengths which should be made for drinks of
every denomination.</p>

<small><i>METHOD OF CALCULATING THE HEIGHT IN THE
COPPER AT WHICH WORTS ARE TO GO OUT.</i></small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap f13">The</span> expected quantities, or lengths of beer and ale,
can only be found by determining at what height in the
copper the worts must be when turned out.</p>

<p>Brewers have several methods of expressing to what
part they would have the worts reduced by boiling.
<i>Brass</i>, is the technical appellation for the upper rim of
the copper; it is a fixed point, from which the estimation
generally takes place, either by inches, or by the nails,
which rivet the parts of the copper together. These
last are not very equal, either in the breadth of their
heads, or their distances from each other. Inches then,
though not specified on the copper, but determined by
the application of a gauge, on which they are marked,
claim the preference. The necessity of coppers being
gauged, and the contents of what they contain on every
inch, both above and below brass, must appear in a
stronger light, the nearer we bring the art to exactness.
The following tables will shew the most useful manner in
which I conceive this gauging should be specified.</p>

<p>By the foregoing table, it is seen that my great copper
holds nearly nine barrels of water to brass, and as the
difference of the volume between boiling worts, of most
denominations, and cold water, is nearly as 7 to 9, the
quantity it will yield of boiling worts will be but seven
barrels. The diameter of this copper, just above brass,
is sixty-eight inches, at a medium, and at that mean it
holds twelve gallons seven pints of cold water, or nearly
eleven gallons of boiling worts, upon an inch.</p>

<p>Hops macerated, by being twice boiled, take up for
every six pound weight a volume, in the copper, equal
to four gallons and a half of water, or a <i>pin</i>.</p>

<p>In a copper, the gauges of which have just been set
down, it is required to know what number of inches a
length of twenty-four barrels must go out at, with fifteen
pounds of hops, the guile of beer to be brewed at
two worts.</p>

<p>When three worts are boiled, the amount of three full
brasses must be deducted from the length; and as the
hops go into the copper three times, they become more
macerated, and take up much less room. The proportion
is then nearly thirteen or fourteen pounds of hops
for each four gallons and a half.</p>

<p>Thus in coppers, which have never been tried or used,
we are able, by the gauges alone, to determine our
lengths; but, as their circumferences are not always
exact, and the worts are of very different strengths, we
should never neglect such trials as may bring us nearer
to accuracy and truth.</p>

<small><i>OF BOILING.</i></small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap f13">It</span> has been a question, whether boiling is necessary to a
wort; but as hops are of a resinous quality, the whole of
their virtues are not yielded by extraction; decoction or
boiling is as needful as the plant itself, and is, together
with extraction and fermentation, productive of that uniformity
of taste in the compound, which constitutes
good beer.</p>

<p>Worts are composed of oils, salts, water, and perhaps
some small portion of earth, from both the malt and
hops. Oils are capable of receiving a degree of heat
much superior to salts, and these again surpass, in this
respect, the power of water. Before a wort can be supposed
to have received the whole of the fire it can admit
of, such a degree of heat must arise, as will be in a
proportion to the quantity of the oils, the salts, and the
water. When this happens, the wort may be said to be
intimately mixed, and to have but one taste. The fire,
made fiercer, would not increase the heat, or more exactly
blend together the constituent parts; this purpose
once obtained, the boiling of the wort is completed.</p>

<p>It follows from thence, that some worts will boil
sooner than others, receive their heat in a less time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
be saturated with less fire; but, as it is impossible, and,
indeed, unnecessary, to estimate exactly the quantities
of oils, salts, and water contained in each different wort,
it is out of our power previously to fix, for any one, the
degree of heat it is capable of. This renders the thermometer
in this case useless, and obliges us to depend
entirely on experiment, and to observe the signs which
accompany the act of ebullition.</p>

<p>Fire, as before has been mentioned, when acting upon
bodies, endeavours to make its way through them in right
lines. A wort set to boil, makes a resistance to the
effort of fire, in proportion to the different parts it is composed
of. The watery particles are, it is imagined, the
first, which are saturated with fire, and becoming lighter
in this manner, endeavour to rise above the whole. The
salts are next, and last of all the oils. From this struggle
proceeds the noise heard when the wort first boils, which
proves how violently it is agitated, before the different
principles are blended one with another. While this
vehement ebullition lasts, we may be sure that the wort
is not intimately mixed, but when the fire has penetrated
and united the different parts, the noise abates, the wort
boils smoother, the steam, instead of clouding promiscuously
as it did at first round the top of the copper,
rises more upright, in consequence of the fire passing
freely in direct lines through the drink, and when the
fierceness of it drives any part of the drink from the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of the wort, the part so separated ascends perpendicularly.
Such are the signs by which we may be satisfied
the first wort, or the strongest part of the extracts, has
been so affected by the fire, as to become nearly of one
taste. If, at this time, it is turned out of the copper, it
appears pellucid, and forms no considerable sediment.</p>

<p>The proper time for the boiling of a wort hitherto has
been determined, without any regard to these circumstances;
hence the variety of opinions on this subject;
greater, perhaps, than on any other part of the process.
While some brewers would confine boiling to so short a
space as five minutes, there are others who believe two
hours absolutely requisite. The first allege, that the
strength of the wort is lost by long boiling; but this argument
will not hold good against the experiment of
boiling a wort in a still, and examining the collected
steam, which appears little else than mere water. Those
who continue boiling the first wort a long time, do it in
order to be satisfied that the fire has had its due effect,
and that the hops have yielded the whole of their virtue.
They judge of this by the wort curdling, and depositing
flakes like snow. If a quantity of this sediment is collected,
it will be found to the taste both sweet and bitter,
and if boiled again in water, the decoction, when cold,
will ferment, and yield a vinous liquor. These flakes,
therefore, contain part of the strength of the wort; they
consist of the first and choicest principles of the malt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and hops, and, by their subsiding, become of little or
no use.</p>

<p>It appears, from these circumstances, that boiling a
first wort too short or too long a time, is equally detrimental,
that different worts require different times, and
these times can only be fixed by observation.</p>

<p>The first wort having received, by the assistance of
the fire, a sufficient proportion of bitter from the hops, is
separated therefrom. The hops, being deprived of part
of their virtues, are, on the other hand, enriched with
some of the glutinous particles of the malt. They are
afterwards, a second, and sometimes a third time, boiled
with the following extractions, and thereby divested not
only of what they had thus obtained, but also of the remaining
part of their preservative qualities. The thinness
and fluidity of these last worts render them extremely
proper for this purpose. Their heat is never so
intense as that of the first, when boiling; for, as they
consist of fewer oils, they are incapable of receiving so
great a degree of heat. This deficiency can only be
made up by doubling or tripling the space of time the
first wort boiled, so that what is wanted in the intenseness
of heat, may be supplied from its continuance.</p>

<p>The following table is constructed from observations
made according to the foregoing rules.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be objected, that, by a long boiling
of the last worts, the rough and austere parts of the hops
may be extracted, and give a disagreeable taste to the
liquor; but it should be observed, this only happens,
either in beers to be long kept, or in such as are brewed
in very hot weather. In the first case the roughness
wears off by age, and grows into strength, and in the
last, it is a check to the proneness musts have in such
seasons to ferment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>
<p>One observation more is necessary under this head;
most coppers, especially such as are made in London, and
set by proper workmen, waste or steam away, by boiling,
about three or four inches of the contained liquor,
in each hour. The quantity wasted being found on
trial, and knowing how much water the copper holds
upon an inch, what is steamed away by boiling in each
brewing, may easily be estimated.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>


<p class="indent"><i>Of the Quantity of Water wasted; and of the Application
of the preceding Rules to two different processes
of Brewing.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap f13">Waste</span> water, in brewing, is that part which, though
employed in the process, yet does not remain in the beers
or ales when made. Under this head is comprehended
the water steamed away in the boiling of the worts; that
which is lost by heating for the extracts; that which
the utensils imbibe when dry; that which necessarily
remains in the pumps and underback; and more than all,
the water which is retained in the grist. The fixing to
a minute exactness how much is thus expended, is both
impossible and unnecessary. Every one of the articles
just now mentioned varies in proportion to the grist, to the
lengths made, to the construction and order of the utensils,
and to the time employed in making the beer. To
these different causes of the steam being lessened or increased,
might be added every change in the atmosphere.
However, as, upon the whole, the quantity of water lost
varies from no reason so much, as from the age and
dryness of the malt, experience is, in this case, our sole
and surest guide. I have, in the following table, placed
under every mode of brewing, how much I have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
necessary to allow for these several wastes and evaporations.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SECTION IX.</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Of the Division of the Water for the respective Worts
and Mashes, and of the Heat adequate to each of these.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap f13">That</span> the whole quantity of water, as well as that of
heat required, ought not, in any brewing, at once to be
applied to the grist, is obvious, both from reason, and
from the example of nature, who, in forming the juice
of the grape, divides the process, and increasing successively
both the moisture and the heat, gives time to each
degree to have its complete effect. A division of the
water and heat to form malt liquors is equally necessary,
but previous to this division the following general rules
may be laid down.</p>

<p>The grist, if possible, is at no time to be left with less
water than what will cover the malt, to put all its parts
in action. In the first mashes for strong beer, an allowance
is to be made for nearly as much water as the grist
will imbibe; and, lastly, the whole quantity of water
used in brewing should be divided, in a proportion analogous
to that of the degrees of heat.</p>

<p>Processes for brewing are carried on either with one
copper or with two. Though the first of these methods
is almost out of use, it may be necessary to give an example
or two of the division of the water used in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
case, the doing which will point out the absurdity of this
practice.</p>

<p>In brewing with one copper, scarcely more than three
mashes can be made; otherwise the time taken up in
boiling the worts, and preparing the subsequent waters
for extraction, would be so long, as to cause the grist to
lose great part of its heat, and, in warm weather, perhaps,
to become sour. The whole water required might
naturally be divided into three equal parts, was it not for
the quantity at first imbibed by the grist; but as, in this
way of brewing, the best management is to make the
first wort of one mash, and the second wort of the other
two, it will be found necessary to allow, for the first extracting
water, four parts out of seven of the whole quantity
required, and to divide the remainder equally for the
other two mashes. Thus, if the whole quantity of water
required was fifty-one barrels, the lengths of the
extracting waters would be as follow:</p>

<table summary="the length" width="70%" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdc">1 Liquor</td><td class="tdc">2 Liquor</td><td class="tdc padr3">3 Liquor</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdc">29</td><td class="tdc">11</td><td class="tdc">11 Barrels.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdc">1 Wort.</td><td class="tdc padr4" colspan="2">╰━━━━━━━━⌄━━━━━━━━╯</td></tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc padr4" colspan="2">2 Wort.</td></tr></table>

<p>The water imbibed and retained by the malt is allowed
for in this computation, which will be found just to every
purpose, for small beer brewed in one copper only.</p>

<p>But in strong beers and ales, with three mashes, whether
brewed at one, two, or three worts, the case will be
somewhat different, as care should always be taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
reserve for every mash a sufficient quantity of water to
apply to the grist. For this reason, no greater proportion
ought to be used in the first mash than that of three
parts out of seven, as the volume of the malt is in a
greater proportion to the quantity of water than in the
preceding case. If, therefore, the whole quantity of
water used was thirty-five barrels, the length of the liquors
would be:</p>

<table summary="the length" width="100%" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdc">1 Liquor</td><td class="tdc">2 Liquor</td><td class="tdc padr3">3 Liquor</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdc">15</td><td class="tdc">10</td><td class="tdc">10 Barrels.</td></tr></table>


<p>Employing only one copper, must from hence appear,
and is allowed to be, bad management; for, in some part
or other of the process, however well contrived, the business
must stand still, and consequently the extracts be
injured, by the air continually affecting them. The best
and most usual practice, and that which here will be set
in example, is to brew with two coppers. Other rules
consequently are necessary to be observed, and I shall be
more particular in the explanation of them.</p>

<p>To preserve order, and to convey our ideas in the
clearest manner, we shall make use of the four modes of
brewing we mentioned, in the fourth section.</p>

<p>The first of these, which implies keeping pale strong
and keeping pale small beers to become spontaneously
fine, are best brewed with two worts and four mashes,
to allow for what is imbibed by the grist, and what is
steamed away during the first part of the process, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
sevenths of the whole of the water employed, and consequently
a like proportion of the number of the degrees
which constitute the difference between the first and last
heats of the whole brewing, are required for the first
wort, and the remainder to the last or second. The proportion
as to the water is permanent, but having now
only a division of heat in a progressive state, for the temperature
to be given to the extracts, to put in practice
the principles laid down in pages 64, 65; the first wort,
however, composed of several mashes, must be of one
uniform heat, though less than that of the second, whose
extracts, though more powerful, must, notwithstanding,
be of equal heat among themselves.</p>

<p>According to the rules laid down in section 8, the
whole quantity of water requisite for a guile of keeping
pale strong, or keeping pale small beer, is fifty-one barrels.
In page 171, we found, including the heat lost at
the time the extract separates from the grist, the first
heat to form this process to be 144 degrees, and the last
158 degrees; the quantity of water, and the difference
between these two degrees, are required to be divided in
such proportions as are best applicable to the purpose
we intend.</p>

formed by nature, our first wort, answering to the germinating
part of her process must be of one uniform
heat in the extracts, as must likewise our second wort:
(See page 165) the mean, then, of the progressive heats
of the first wort will be that which must be applied both
to the first and second mashes, and the mean of the progressive
heats of the second wort, that which must direct

<p>Admitting of the necessary variations in the medium
heats which are to govern processes for different pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>poses,
and of those in the number of degrees forming the
constituent parts of the must, in proportion as the drinks
are to be formed, either to become spontaneously fine,
or made so by precipitation, or intended for a longer or
shorter duration. This rule will be found universally
true, when beers are brewed with two worts: but when,
for the benefit of the drink, or on account of the
smallness of the utensils, as is often the case, when
the second mode of extraction is put in practice, we are
obliged to carry on the process with three worts, these
proportions must necessarily be altered, and the following
have, in this case, been found most advantageous.</p>

<p>The first and second wort ought to have two thirds of
the water; the first wort two thirds of this quantity, the
second the remainder of this, and the third wort one
third part of the whole.</p>

<p>Porter or brown beer is the sort of drink, in which
this division is most commonly observed. Let the whole
quantity of water to be used be that of the brewing, of
which the elements have been laid down, (page 233) or
54 barrels.</p>

<p>Five degrees to be proportioned in the first wort, and
these deducted from 7 degrees, the number allowed for
the first and second wort, there remains two degrees for
the second wort; and seven degrees deducted from ten,
the whole difference, leaves three degrees, to be proportioned
in the third and last wort.</p>

<p>A grist of eleven quarters of malt is too large, to admit
of the water allowed for the first wort to be equally
divided between the first and second mash; therefore,
rather than use the whole 24 barrels in one mash, a
sufficient quantity only must be applied to the first
mash, both to work it, and to get as much of the extract
to come down, as will save the bottom of the copper it
is to be pumped into. By this management, there will
be enough left to form the second extract with, or what
by the brewers is termed the piece liquor. The exact
quantity of water the first mash should have, might be
referred to the following section, but the order we have
laid down, will excuse our anticipating thereon.</p>

<p>It has been found, and will hereafter be proved, that a
volume of eleven quarters of malt, dried to 130 degrees,
is equal to 6,32 barrels of liquid measure, that malt in
general requires twice its volume of water to wet it, and
this quantity of water is retained after every tap is spent.</p>

<p>And, if proved as before, the same correspondence
will be found with the medium governing heat.</p>

<p>The third mode of extraction is intended for a drink
which is soon to be ready for use, in which, in the coldest
season of the year, transparency is expected, and, in the
hottest months, soundness: to procure these intents, we
have already shewn (page 191) it was necessary to vary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the medium heats governing these several processes, in
proportion as the seasons of the year differed as to heat
and cold. Our present business is a proper division of
the whole quantity of water necessary for brewing, into
the respective worts and mashes, and to apply to each,
the adequate degree of heat: one single example will
suffice for the operation, and the whole variety this drink
is subjected to, will be expressed in the table subjoined.</p>

<p>The general practice to brew common small beer, and
which is best, is to form it with two worts and four
mashes, and, in this case, as was before practised for
keeping pale beers, in order to allow for the water at
first absorbed by the grist; four sevenths of the whole
quantity is required for the first wort, and the remainder
for the second wort, dividing these quantities again into
equal parts, for their respective mashes. As a speedy
spontaneous pellucidity is expected in every season of
the year, and as every means for producing this without
affecting the soundness of the drink, must be put in
practice, the whole number of constituent parts are not
only applied, but likewise the progressive heats suffered
to take place: for here, through necessity, we are compelled
to forsake the rules nature pointed out, (as in
pages 64, 65); the reasons why are obvious; this drink
receives no benefit by the slow progress nature recommends,
and therefore very little by the impressions of
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>In page 232, we found the whole quantity of water to
be used for the brewing there specified, fifty-one barrels,
and in page 191, we find when the heat of the air is at
60, the first heat is 154, the last 174 degrees.</p>

<p>The last business of this section is to divide the quantity
of water requisite to brew pale ales or amber, and to
apply to such divisions their necessary degrees of heat.
This liquor is rather an effort of art, than an exact imitation
of nature, as in it the greatest transparency, joined
to the greatest strength, is expected in a very short
time. To obtain these ends, the whole number of the
constituent properties of malt and two mashes only are
employed. In the first, in order to favor its pellucidity,
the lowest adequate extracting degree must be used;
and in the second, to cause the malt to yield the whole
of its necessary parts, the highest fitting heat must be
applied; the whole of the process is, nevertheless, subjected
to the governing medium heat of 138 degrees, the
highest which admits of voluntary brightness. But where
a drink is formed with two mashes only, and boiled off
in one entire wort, to keep the due proportion between
the quantity of water used, and the heat required in the
extracts, and at the same time to allot the proper quantity
for what is imbibed by the grist, the most convenient
division found, will be three-fifths of the whole
quantity of water to be applied to the first mash, and the
remaining two-fifths to the other. I know to this, custom
may be objected, that the first mash for amber
should be a stiff one, in order the better to retain the
heat; but this, in the division here proposed, may
equally be obtained by a proper allowance made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
attemperating of the water, without affecting the proportion
of the heats required, as otherwise must be the
case.</p>

<p>Thus having shewn how to ascertain the quantities of
the malt, the hops, the water, and the heat to be used,
and to proportion them to each other, as the good or
bad properties of beers arise from the extracts, and fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
is the governing agent, we must now seek the means
to administer the right portion of heat, and so to temper
the water that is to form the extracts, as not to be
disappointed of our intentions. In the calculations made
for this purpose, not only the water in the copper, but
the value and effect of the grist, as to heat and cold, must
be considered.</p>

<p class="center"><i>An enquiry into the Volume of Malt, in order to reduce
the Grist to liquid Measure.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gallon, by which malt is measured, though less,
is nearly of the same capacity with that, which is used
for beer or water. The quarter of malt, contains 64
gallons of this measure, and the barrel, within the bills
of mortality, according to the gauges used by the excise,
contains 36 gallons, but without the bills, 34;
though the first quantity is the measure for sale throughout
the kingdom. Hence it would appear, that proportioning
the grain to the barrel of water would be no difficult
undertaking. This however is so far from being
the case, that, after having made use of several calculations
to help us to the true proportions, we shall find,
they want the corroborating proofs of actual experience,
to be entirely depended upon.</p>

<p>The ultimate parts of water are so very small, as to
make this, as well as all other liquids, appear to the eye
one continued uniform body, without any interstices.
This cannot be said of malt laying together either whole
or ground; there are numbers of vacancies between the
corns, when whole, and between the particles when
ground, but for our present purpose the volume occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
by any quantity of malt is properly no more, than the
space which would be occupied by every individual corn,
either whole or cut asunder, were they as closely joined
together as water.</p>

<p>To determine, with precision, the quantity of cold
water to be added to that, which is brought to the boiling
point, (an act by the brewers called <i>cooling in</i>)
it is necessary to know, what proportion a quarter of
malt bears to the measure of a barrel of water. Several
operations will be found requisite to come to this knowledge;
viz. to take several gauges of different brewings,
more especially in the first part of the process; to be
well acquainted with the degree of dryness of the malt
used, the heat of the first extract, and the quantity of
liquor the mash tun holds upon every inch; to find out
what degrees of expansion are produced by the different
degrees of heat in the first mash, how much less water
the mash tun holds upon an inch when hot, than it does
when cold, what quantity of water is lost by evaporation,
and in what proportion at the several terms of the process.
In order to put this in practice, the gauges of the
following brewings were taken.</p>

<p class="center">5 quarters of malt dried to 125 degrees.</p>

<p>The heat of the first extract was 136 degrees, to which
adding two degrees, for what is lost by the tap spending,
the true heat of the mash is 138 degrees.</p>

<p>The first extract, before it is blended with hops, may
be estimated to be nearly as strong as a first wort of
common small beer. This, when under a strong ebullition,
raised the thermometer to 216 degrees, and seven
barrels of such a wort, when boiling, occupied an equal
space with nine barrels of cold water, at the mean temperature
of 60 degrees. Now, if the degrees of expansion
follow the proportion of those of heat, the following
table, constructed upon this supposition, will shew how
many barrels of cold water would be necessary to occupy
the same space with seven barrels of wort of different
heats.</p>

12B. 2F. 3G. or 428 gallons, of which one fifth is supposed
to be steamed away, when the first liquor is gone
through the whole process of the extraction: but as the
gauges of the malt and water together are taken before
the tap is set, in the beginning of the process, the whole
evaporation ought not to be deduced, and one sixth
seems to be a sufficient allowance on this account. We

<p>The more the malt has been dried, the larger the interstices
are between its parts; the quantity of water it
admits will consequently be greater than what is absorbed
by such as is less dry. More of this last malt will be necessary
to make a volume, equal to that of the barrel of
water; and every different degree of dryness must cause
a variety in this respect. It will therefore be proper to
repeat the operation with a high-dried grist.</p>

<p>Having found the volume of malt at two distant terms
of dryness, we might divide the intermediate degrees in
the same manner as we have done before, could the certainty
of these calculations be entirely depended upon;
but as some allowances have been made without immediate
proof, how near soever truth the result thereof may
from experiments appear, it may be proper to point out
what is wanting to make our suppositions satisfactory.</p>

<p>Some part of the calculation depends on the quantity
evaporated; this, in the same space of time, may be
more or less, as the fire under the water is brisk or slow,
or as the weight of the atmosphere differs. The gauges
are taken at the time the malt and water are in contact,
and more or less water may be imbibed in proportion,
both of the dryness and age of the malt; water as a fluid,
malt as a porous solid body, must differ in their expansion,
but in what proportion is to me unknown; effervescence
may be another cause of want of exactness; the
different cut the malt has had in the mill, its being or
not being truly prepared, and lastly the difference as to
time, of the mashing or standing of the grist, prevent
our relying wholly upon the calculation. It is, however,
not improbable that some of these incidents correct
one another. Since 1,70 quarter of malt dried to 125 degrees
are equal to one barrel of water, and 1,86 quarter
of malt dried to 140 have the same volume, the difference
being but 16 parts out of 100, the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
error cannot be very great, and one quarter six bushels
of malt may, at a medium, be estimated of the same volume
with one barrel of water. But, as experience is the
surest guide, I have, from a very great number of different
brewings, collected the following proportions, and
repeatedly found them to be true. I have added, in the
table, the weight malt ought to have, at every degree of
dryness.</p>

<p>With a table thus constructed, it is very easy to reduce
every grist to its proper volume of water. Suppose
those of the brewings we have already mentioned;
that of the small beer consists of 6 quarters of malt dried
to 130 degrees, the proportion of which in the table is as
1,75 to 1.</p>

<table summary="the elements" cellpadding="5" border="0"><tr>

<td class="tdc">If&nbsp;&nbsp;1,75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">1</td><td class="tdc">6</td><td class="tdc">3,42.</td></tr></table>

<p>These six quarters of malt occupy therefore an equal
volume with 3,42 barrels of water. A brown beer grist
of 11 quarters dried to 130 degrees; the proportion of
this in the table is as 1,74 to 1.</p>

<table summary="the elements" cellpadding="5" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdc">Malt.</td><td class="tdc">Water.</td><td class="tdc"> Malt.</td><td class="tdc">Water.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdc">If&nbsp;&nbsp;1,74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">1</td><td class="tdc">11</td><td class="tdc">6,32</td></tr></table>


<p>The volume of these 11 quarters of malt is therefore
the same with that of 6,32 barrels of water, and the whole
being brought to one denomination, we are enabled to
find the heat of the first mash; but the effervescence occasioned
by the union of the malt and water must prevent
this calculation being strictly true, the consideration of
which shall take place hereafter.</p>

<p>The circumstances are different in the other mashes:
the waters used for these, meet a grist already saturated,
and the volume is increased beyond the quantity
found for dry malt. The quantity to be allowed for
this increase cannot be determined by our former calcu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>lations,
and new trials are to be made, in order to fix
upon the true proportion.</p>

<p>Gauging is undoubtedly the most certain method of
proceeding in these researches; but even this becomes
less sure, on account of the expansion, evaporation,
effervescence, and other incidents already mentioned.&mdash;Our
errors however cannot be very considerable, when
we deduce our conclusions from numerous and sufficiently
varied experiments.</p>

<p>The volume of the grist of pale malt was found, after
the parting of the first extract, to be 15,41 inches,
though the space occupied by the malt, when dry, was
only 5,51 inches: and the volume of the brown grist,
at the same period, was 22,36 inches, though the dry
malt filled only a space of 8,21 inches. The proportion
in both these cases, and in all those which I have tried,
answers nearly to one third, so that the volume of the
grist, in the second and all subsequent mashes, may be
estimated at three times the bulk of the malt when dry,
and this is sufficiently accurate for the operations of
brewing, in which, for conveniency sake, the application
of whole numbers should be effected.</p>

<p>As it is found, by the gauges, that the goods, after the
several taps are spent, remain sensibly of the same volume,
or at least very little diminished; may we not conclude,
the parts absorbed by the water, in which the virtue
of the grain and the strength of the beer consist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
are contained in an amazing small compass? It is indeed
true that hot waters and repeated mashes do swell somewhat
the hulls and skins of the malt, but no allowance
made for this increase will be sufficient, to remove the
cause of our surprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> degree of heat, which causes water to boil is determined,
by Farenheit’s scale, to 212. It is in our
power to give to any part of the extracting water this
degree of heat; and by adding to it a sufficient proportion
of water of an equal heat with that of the air, and
blending these two quantities with the grist, to bring the
whole to the required temperature. The rules for obtaining
this end are extremely simple, and cannot be
unknown to those, who are skilled in arithmetical operations.
But as our view is to render this part of our

to lay down these rules, and to illustrate them by the examples

<p>So long as the mixture consists only of two quantities
of different heat, as is always the case of the first mash,
the preceding solution takes place. But in the second
and other mashes, where three bodies are concerned,
each of different heat, viz. the boiling water, the cold
water, and the mash, are to be mixed, and brought to a
determinate degree, the rule must be different; yet, like
the former, it is the same with what is used in similar
cases of allaying, when different metals are to be melted
down into a compound of a certain standard, or different
ingredients of different value to be blended, in order to
make a mixture of a determinate price. What the different
density of the metals, or the different value of the
ingredients are, in these cases, the different degrees of
heat of the boiling water, the grist, and the air, are in
this.</p>

<p>The first mash for the six quarters of small beer, had
154 degrees of heat, but this and every mash loses, in
the time the extract is parting from it, 4 degrees, which
reduces the heat to 150 degrees. The volume of this
grist, in its dry state, was 3,42 barrels, but now, by being
expanded, and having imbibed much water, it occupies
three times that space, or 10,26 barrels; the air is supposed
to continue in the same state of 60 degrees of
heat. The length and heat to be given to the three remaining
mashes, are as follows. (See page 247.)</p>

<small><i>OF MASHING.</i></small></h3>
</div>

<p><span  class="smcap">Of</span> late years, great progress has been made towards
perfecting the construction and disposition of brew-house
utensils, which seem to admit of very little farther improvement.
The great copper, in which the waters for
two of the extracts receive their temperature, is built
very near the mash tun, so that the liquid may readily
be conveyed to the ground malt, without losing any
considerable heat. A cock is placed at the bottom
of the copper, which being opened, lets the water have
its course, through a trunk, to the real bottom of the
mash tun. It soon fills the vacant space, forces itself a
passage through many holes made in a false bottom,
which supports the grist, and, as the water increases in
quantity, it buoys up the whole body of the corn.</p>

<p>In order to blend together the water and the malt,
rakes are first employed. By their horizontal motion,
less violent than that of mashing, the finest parts of the
flower are wetted, and prevented from being scattered
about, or lost in the air.</p>

<p>But as a more intimate penetration and mixture are
necessary, oars are afterwards made use of. They move
nearly perpendicularly, and by their beating, or mashing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the grains of the malt are bruised, and a thorough imbibition
of the water procured.</p>

<p>The time employed in this operation cannot be settled
with an absolute precision. It ought to be continued,
till the malt is sufficiently incorporated with the water,
but not so long as till the heat necessary to the grist be
lessened. As bodies cool more or less speedily, in proportion
to their volume, and the cohesion of their parts,
a mash which has but little water, commonly called a
<i>stiff mash</i>, requires a longer mashing to be sufficiently
divided, and, from its tenacity, is less liable to lose its
heat. This accounts for the general rule, that the first
mash ought always to be the longest.</p>

<p>After mashing, the malt and water are suffered to stand
together unmoved, generally for a space of time equal
to that they were mashed in. Was the extract drawn
from the grain as soon as the mashing is over, many of
the particles of the malt would be brought away undissolved,
and the liquor be turbid, though not rich. But,
by leaving it some time in contact with the grain, without
any external motion, many advantages are gained.
The different parts of the extract acquire an uniform
heat, the heaviest and most terrestrial subside, the pores
being opened, by heat, imbibe more readily the water,
and give way to the attenuation and dissolution of the
oils. When the tap comes to be set, or the extract to
be drawn from the grist, as the bottom of the mash is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
become more compact, the liquor is a longer time in its
passage through it, is in a manner strained, and consequently
extracts more strength from the malt, and becomes
more homogeneous and transparent.</p>

<p>Such are the reasons why the grist should not only be
mashed pretty long, but likewise be suffered to rest an
equal time. It is the practice of most brewers, and experience
shews it is best, to rake the first mash half an
hour, to mash it one hour more, and to suffer it to stand
one hour and a half. The next extract is commonly
mashed three quarters of an hour, and stands the same
space of time; the third, and all that follow, are allowed
one half hour each, both for mashing and standing.</p>

<p>The heat of the grist being in this manner equally
spread, and the infusion, having received all the strength
from the malt, which such a heat could give it, after
every mashing and standing, is let out of the tun. This,
undoubtedly, is the fittest time to observe whether our
expectations have been answered. The thermometer is
the only instrument proper for this purpose, and ought
to be placed, or held, where the tap is set, adjoining to
the mouth of the underback cock. The observation is
best made, when the extract has run nearly half; and as,
by it, we are to judge with what success the process is
carried on, it is necessary to examine every incident,
which may cause a deviation from the calculated heat.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Of the Incidents, which cause the Heat of the Extract to
vary from the Calculation, the allowances they require,
and the means to obviate their effects.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>By</big></span> incidents, I understand such causes as effect either
the malt, the water, or the mash, during the time the
brewing is carrying on, so as to occasion their heat to differ
from what is determined by calculation. As these
might frequently be a reason of disappointment, an inquiry
into their number and effects will not only furnish
means to prevent and rectify the errors they occasion,
but also serve to confirm this practice.</p>

<p>In our researches on the volume of malt, some notice
was taken of the increase of bodies by heat, and the loss
occasioned by evaporation. Water, when on the point
of ebullition, occupies the largest space it is susceptible
of; but contracting again, when cold water is added to
it, the true volume of both, when mixed together, remains
uncertain, and may cause a difference between the
calculated and real degree of heat. This cause, however,
producing an effect opposite to, and balanced in part by
evaporation, becomes so inconsiderable, as hardly to deserve
any farther consideration.</p>

<p>Water, just on the point of ebullition, may be esteem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>ed
heated to 212 degrees. Though, by the continuation
of the fire, or by any other cause<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>, the heat never goes
beyond this, yet was cold water added to that, which violently
boils, the degree expected from the mixture
would be exceeded; for the cold water absorbing the
superfluous quantity of fire, which otherwise flies off,
becomes hot itself, and frustrates the intent. The time,
therefore, of adding the cold water to the hot is immediately
before the ebullition begins, or when it is just
ended; and in proportion as we deviate from this practice,
the heat in the extract will differ from the calculated
degree.</p>

<p>The water, for every mash, should, as near as possible,
be got ready to boil, and be cooled in just before it is to
be used. A liquor, which remains a long time after the
ebullition is over, and the fire has been damped up,
loses part of its heat, if cold water is applied to it, the
effect cannot be the same as it would have been at first.
On the contrary, if the liquor is got ready too soon, and
cold water immediately added to it, in order to gain the
proper degree of temperature, by leaving the mixture
long together, though the fire is stopped up, more heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>than necessary will be received from the copper and
brickwork, especially if the utensils are large. In both
cases, the degree in the extract will not answer the
intent.</p>

<p>The effect of effervescence next deserves our consideration,
but this takes place only when the water first
comes in contact with the malt. Germinated grains
must, to become malt, be dried so, that their particles
are made to recede from one another, thus deprived of
the parts, to which their union was due, when they come
in contact with other bodies, (as water) they strongly attract
the unitive particles they want, and excite an intestine
motion, which generates heat. This motion and
this heat are more active in proportion as the grain has
more strongly been impressed by fire, and the extracting
water is hotter.</p>

<p>A large quantity of liquor applied to the grist is less
heated than a small one, by the power of effervescence.
The least quantity of water, necessary to shew that
power, must be just so much as the malt requires to be
saturated, which we have seen to be double the volume
of the grain. When more water than this is applied to
the grist, the real effervescing heat is by so much lessened,
being dispersed in more than a sufficient space.</p>

<p>A table shewing the heat of effervescence for every degree
of dryness in the malt, can only be formed from
observations. To apply this table to practice, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
find out, for any quantity of water used in the first
mash, the degrees of heat produced by effervescence,
three times the volume of the grist must be multiplied by
the number expressing the effervescing heat for malt of
such a degree of dryness, and this produce be divided by
the real volume of the whole mash.</p>

<p>Malt dried only to 119 degrees, raises no effervescence,
and the strongest is generated by malt dried to
176 degrees; the heat produced by this amounts to 40
degrees, but the number of effervescing degrees, in this
or any other case, are reached but from success attending
our endeavours, ultimately to penetrate the malt by
heated water, or not until the grist is perfectly saturated,
which, in point of time, generally takes up the whole
space of the first mashing and standing; the air, therefore,
cannot cause any diminution of heat, an incident
which affects considerably every subsequent mash.</p>

<p>The little copper being more distant from the mash
tun than the other, the water there prepared, in its passage
to the goods, loses some part of its heat. And in
proportion to the quantity of water used, to the number
of the extracts that have been made, and according as
the mashes have more or less consistency, in the same
time do they part with more or less of their heat. Observations
made separately upon strong and small beer,
have shewn the proportions of this loss to be as follows:</p>


<p class="center"><i>For strong beer.</i></p>

<p>A grist not perfectly malted, or one which contains many
hard corns, disappoints the expectation of the computed
degree, as the volume cannot be such as was estimated
from an equal dryness of true germinated grain. It has
been observed, that, in perfect malt, the shoot is very
near pressing through the exterior skin. By so much as
it is deficient in this particular, must it be accounted only
as dried barley, or hard corn. I know no better way of
judging what proportion of the corn is hard to what is
malted, than by putting some in water, the grains not
sufficiently grown will sink to the bottom. Were this to
be done in a glass cylinder, the proportion between the
hard and malted corn might be found with exactness.&mdash;The
unmalted parts being estimated with regard to their
volume, as barley, a quarter of them will be to the barrel
of water as 1,56 to 1<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>. Supposing, therefore, that,
in the brown beer grist, before mentioned, the proportion
of hard corns is of two quarters out of eleven, to discover
the true volume of such a grist, the following rule may
be used.</p>

<p>By means of this rule, we may find what increase of

<p>But the brewing of such malt ought to be avoided as
much as possible, as the hard parts afford no strength to
the extract.</p>

<p>If a grist is not well and thoroughly mashed, the heat
not being uniformly distributed in the different parts of
the extract, the liquor of the thermometer, when placed
in the running stream of the tap, will fluctuate, and, at
different times, shew different degrees of heat. In this
case, the best way is to take the mean of several observations,
and to estimate that to be the true heat of the
mash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>If the gauges of the coppers are not exactly taken, a
variation must be expected.</p>

<p>Though the small and hourly variations in the state of
the atmosphere have but little influence upon our numbers,
a difference will be observed in any considerable
and sudden changes either of the heat or of the weight of
the air. Our instruments, and in particular the thermometer,
are supposed to be well constructed and graduated.
If the water cooled in with is more or less hot
than estimated, or if the time of mashing or standing is
either more or less than was allowed for, the computation
must be found to vary from the event.</p>

<p>While the malt is new, if the fire it has received from
the kiln has not sufficiently spent itself, this additional
heat is not easily accounted for. This is likewise the
case, when malt is laid against the hot brickwork of coppers;
and, on the contrary, a loss of dryness may be occasioned,
if the store rooms are damp.</p>

<p>The artist should be attentive to all these incidents;
the not pointing them out might appear neglectful; enumerating
more would exceed the bounds of use.</p>

<p>Small grists brewed in large utensils lose their heats
more readily, by laying thin, and greatly exposed to the
air; and, on the contrary, a less allowance, for the loss
of heat, is required in large grists, and to which the
utensils are in proportion.</p>

<p>This really is the only difference between brewings car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>ried
on in large public brewhouses, and those made in
small private places, in other respects constructed upon
the same plan, and with an equal care. Prejudice has
propagated an idea, that where the grists are large, and
the utensils in proportion, stronger extracts could be
forced from the malt, in proportion to the quantity, and
that more delicate beers could be made in smaller vessels
less frequently used. These assertions, from what has
been said, will, I hope, need no farther enquiry: the degrees
of heat for the extracts are fixed for every intent,
and it cannot be advantageous, by any means, to deviate
from them. Brewings will most probably succeed in all
places, where the grist is not so large as to exceed the
bounds of man’s labour, and not so small as to prevent
the heat from being uniformly maintained. The disadvantages
are great on all sides, when a due proportion is
not observed between the utensils and the works carried
on.</p>

<p>It will now be proper to continue the delineation of
our two brewings, and to put all the circumstances relating
to them under one point of view.</p>

<p>These computations, perhaps, will appear more troublesome
than they really are; but, besides the facility
which exercise always gives for operations of this kind,
the satisfaction of proceeding upon known principles,
will, I hope, encourage the practitioner to prefer certitude
to doubt. One advantage must greatly recommend
it, and at the same time secure the uniformity of our
malt liquors; tables for each sort and season may be
made beforehand, and will serve as often as the circumstances
are the same. The trouble of the computations
will by that means be saved, and by collecting together
different brewings of the same kind, the artist will, at
any time, have it in his power to see what effect the
least deviation from his rules had upon his operations,
and to what degree of precision he may hope to arrive.</p>

<p>That nothing may be wanting in this work, to facilitate
the intelligence thereof, I shall insert the method of
keeping the account of actual brewings, made according
to the computations I have here successively traced
down. The first column contains the charges of the
coppers, and the numbers computed; the next, the
brewings made from these numbers, with their dates,
and the degrees of heat found by observation; the variations
occasioned by unforeseen incidents are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
to be allowed for, at cooling in, by the artist, upon the
principle, that each inch of cooling in answers to four
degrees of heat. Noting in this manner the elements
of every brewing we make, when the drink comes into
a fit state for use, we are enabled to compare our practice
with the principles which directed it; by this
means, experiments constantly before our eyes will be
the most certain and best foundation for improvement.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Of the disposition of the Worts when turned out of the
Copper, the thickness they should be laid at in the
Backs to cool, and the heat they should retain for fermentation,
under the several circumstances.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a process of brewing is regularly carried on
with two coppers, the worts come in course to boil, as
the extracts which formed them are produced. It would
be tedious and unnecessary to describe the minutest parts
of the practice; which, in some small degree, varies as
brewing offices are differently constructed, or the utensils
are differently arranged. Without the assistance of
a brewhouse, it is perhaps impossible to convey to the
imagination the entire application of the rules before
laid down, but with one, I hope they need little, if any,
farther explanation.</p>

<p>The worts, when boiled, are musts possessing an intended
proportion of all the fermentable principles, except
air; this was expelled by fire, and until their too
great heat is removed, cannot be administered to them.</p>

<p>In musts, which spontaneously ferment, the external air
excites in their oils an agitation, which, heating and opening
the pores of the liquor, expands and puts in action
the internal air they possess. The case is not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the same with regard to those musts which require ferments.
The air wanted in boiled worts must be supplied
by the means of yeast. Was the heat of the
wort such, as to occasion the immediate bursting of all
the air bubbles contained in the yeast, an effervescence
rather than a fermentation would ensue. Now a heat superior
to 80 degrees has this effect, and is therefore one
of the boundaries in artificial fermentation; 40 degrees
of heat, for want of being sufficient to free the air inclosed
in the yeast bubbles, and to excite their action, is the
other. Within these limits, must the wort be cooled to;
and the precise degree, which varies according to the
different circumstances they are in, and to the intent they
are to be applied to, is, together with the means of procuring
this heat, the purport of this section.</p>

<p>Worts, when in the copper, boil at a heat somewhat
superior to that of 212 degrees; the more this is exceeded,
the stronger the liquor is. The instant the wort is
suffered to go out of the copper, it loses more heat than
in any other equal space of time after it has been exposed
to the air. In the course of the natural day, or in 24
hours, the heat of the air varies sometimes, (especially in
summer) as much as 20 degrees. If the wort, after having
reached the lowest heat in this interval, was suffered
to remain in the coolers, till the return of a greater
in the air, it would be influenced by this increase, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>pand,
and be put in action; and, should there be at this
time any elastic air in any part of the coolers, which
sometimes happens, either from the sediment of former
worts, from the backs not being clean swept, or from the
wood being old and spungy, the wort supposed to be left
to cool, will, by receiving the additional heat from the
air, and blending with the incidental elastic air adhering
to the coolers, bring on, in a lower degree, the act of
fermentation; an accident by the artist called the <i>backs
being set</i>.</p>

<p>For this reason, a wort should never be suffered to lay
so long as to be exposed to the hazard of this injury,
which generally may happen in somewhat more than
twelve hours. Thus are we directed to spread or lay our
worts so thin in the backs, as they may come to their
due temperature within this space; in summer it is sufficient
if the backs be covered; in winter a depth of two
inches may oftentimes be allowed with safety.</p>

<p>From the inclination of the coolers or backs to the place,
where the worts run off, from their largeness, or from
the wind and air warping them, a wort seldom, perhaps
never, lays every where at an equal depth, and cannot
therefore become uniformly cold in the same space of
time. This renders the use of the thermometer difficult,
though not impracticable. To supply the want of this
instrument with some degree of certainty, the hand
intended to feel the worts, is brought to the heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
body, by placing it in the bosom, until it has fully received
it. Then dipping the fingers into the liquor, we
judge, by the sensation it occasions, whether it is come
to a proper degree of coolness to be fermented. As the
external parts of our bodies are generally of about 90
degrees of heat, some degree of cold must be felt, before
the worts are ready for the purpose of fermentation.
But that degree varies for different drinks, and in different
seasons. I will endeavour to point out the rules to
form a judgment for the heat of small beer worts. A
greater precision, both for that and for other drinks, will
be found in the following table.</p>

<p>In July and August, no other rule can be given, than
that the worts be got as cold as possible. The same rule
holds good in June and September, except the season is
unnaturally cold. In May and October, worts should be
let down nearly thirty degrees colder than the hand; in
April, November, and March, the worts should be about
twenty degrees colder than the hand, and only ten in
January, February and December.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought that the heats here specified
are great, but worts cool as they run from the backs
to the working tuns, they are also affected by the coldness
of the tuns themselves, and perhaps these circumstances
are not so trivial, but that an allowance should
be made for them. In general, the heat of no must
should exceed 60 degrees, because fermentation increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
this or any other degree, in proportion to that, under
which this particular part of the process begins. To render
the thermometer more useful, and to suit it to our
conveniency, we have before supposed every first mash for
common small beer to be made at four o’clock in the
morning: in this case, and where the worts are not laid
to cool at more than one inch in depth, the following
table may be said to be a measure of time, the first and
last worts for this drink should be let down at.</p>

<p>Small beer worts being nearly alike in consistency, the
necessary variations from this table must be less frequent.
It is true, some difference may happen from the exposition
of a brewhouse, or from other circumstances, admitting
more or less freely the intercourse of the air, and
be such as might alter, upon the whole, the times set
down in the preceding page. Brown beer worts, which
are more thick and glutinous, and especially amber
worts, which are stronger still, will require other and
longer terms to come to their due temperature, to be fermented
at; but when once observed and noted, according
to various degrees of heat in the air, at 8 o’clock each
morning, the conveniency of these observations must be
such, in this business, which requires long watchings and
attendance, that no arguments are necessary to recommend
what is rather indulgence than industry.</p>

<p>The consequences of worts being set to ferment at, in
an undue heat, are the following. In strong beers, or
such as are intended for long keeping, if the worts be
too cold, a longer time is required for their fermentation,
and the drinks grow fine with more difficulty; if, on the
contrary, they are too hot, acidity, and a waste of some
of the spiritous parts must ensue. Either of these disadvantages
appears more conspicuous in common small
beer, as, in winter, this drink is seldom kept a sufficient
time to correct the defect, and in summer, from being
too hot, it becomes putrid, or, in the terms of the brewery,
is hereby <i>foxed</i>.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SECTION XV.</h3>
</div>
<p class="center"><i>Of Yeast, its nature, and contents, and of the manner and
quantities in which it is to be added to the worts.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Musts</big></span>, or worts, though ever so rich, when unfermented,
yield no spirit by distillation, nor inebriate, if
drank in any quantity. The oils, as yet not sufficiently
attenuated for this purpose, become so only by fermentation.
Air is absolutely necessary for this process, in
the course of which, some of the aerial parts mixing
with, and being enveloped by, oils greatly thinned, are
enclosed in vesicles not sufficiently strong to resist the
force of elasticity, or prevent a bursting and explosion.
In the progress of the act, the air joins with oils both
coarser, and charged with earthy particles, a coat is
formed capable of resisting its expansion, and if the bubbles
cannot come to a volume sufficient to be floated in
and upon the liquor, they sink to the bottom, and take
the appellation of <i>lees of wine</i>.

Between these two extremes, there is another case,
when the bubbles are sufficiently strong to hold the air,
but not weighty enough to sink. After floating in, they
emerge, and are buoyed upon the surface of the liquor,
and there remaining entire, are termed the <i>flowers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>wine</i>. Both lees and flowers are, therefore, vesicles
formed out of the must, filled with elastic air, and, either
separately, or when mixed together, they obtain the general
denomination of <i>yeast</i>.

We have often mentioned the power of fire, in driving
the air out of worts. Yeast, fraught with the principle
now wanted for fermentation, is, therefore, the properest
subject to be added to the must; but its texture is various,
in proportion to the different heats of the extracts it
was formed from. Keeping drinks, extracted with hotter
waters, yield yeast, the oils of which have a greater
spissitude. It is consequently slower, more certain, and
most fit to promote a cool and gentle fermentation.
That, on the contrary, which is produced from small
beer, being weak, and acting at once, is apt to excite a
motion like that of effervescence; such yeast ought,
therefore, not to be used, but when there is no possibility
to obtain the other.

The longer wines or beers are under the first act of
fermentation, the greater variety will be found in the
texture of the bubbles, which compose their flower and
lees. Wines made out of grapes, in general, require a
time somewhat longer than the worts of malt, before this
first period is at an end; and we have seen, that in them
fermentation first brings forth air bubbles, whose constituent
parts are most tender, and afterwards some that
are of a stronger texture. As malt liquors require a less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>time to ferment, their bubbles are more similar: on this
account, the whole quantity of yeast necessary to a wort
should not be applied at once, lest the air bladders,
bursting nearly in the same time, should prevent that
gradual action, which seems to be the aim of nature in
all her operations.

Keeping beers, formed from low dried malts, occasion
the greatest variety of heat in the extracts, and from
hence these musts form yeast, whose bubbles differ
most in magnitude and strength. A drink, then, properly
made from pale malt, nearly resembles natural
wines, especially when they are so brewed as to require
precipitation to become transparent.

<i>Cleansing</i> is dividing the drink into several casks; this
checks the motion occasioned by fermentation, and consequently
retards it. To prevent this from being too
sensibly felt, some yeast should be put to the drink,
before it is removed into the casks. As the constituent
parts, in strong beers, are more tenacious than in small,
and require a greater motion to entertain the fermentation,
the drinks, before they be thus divided, should, besides
the addition of the yeast, be well roused with a
scoop, or by some other means, for one hour. This not
only blends all the parts together, but attenuates and
heats the liquor, and makes it more ready to begin to
ferment again, when in the casks. One sixth part of the
whole of the yeast used is generally reserved for this purpose;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>and the remainder is equally divided as the worts
are let down. It must be observed, that this stirring,
though as necessary to small, as to strong drinks, is only
to be continued for a space of time proportioned to their
strength.

We have before seen, when a grist of malt is entirely
extracted to form common small beer, soon to be expended,
one gallon of yeast to eight bushels of grain affords
a sufficient supply of air to perfect the fermentation.
This takes place when the heat of the air is at 40
degrees, but, at the highest fermentable degree, experience
shews, that half that quantity is as much as is necessary.
For some ales, the whole virtue of the malt is not
extracted, and what remains is appropriated to the making
of small beer: the quantity of yeast used for these
drinks must be only in proportion to the strength extracted.
From these premises, the following tables have
been formed, exhibiting the quantity of yeast proper for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>the several sorts of drinks, at the different heats of the air.</p>

<p>This table is founded on the supposition that, the virtue
or strength extracted from one quarter of malt for
amber, is equal to 5/6 of the whole. In every heat of the
air, the quantity of yeast to be used for common small
beer made after ale, must be one fifth part of the quantity
which the ale required, the additional strength obtained
from reboiling the hops, requiring further proportion;
if, for keeping small beer, nearly in the proportion of six
pints of yeast to five barrels of beer, this will be found
to correspond with the rule delivered in the foregoing
table.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Of practical Fermentation, and the management of the
several sorts of Malt Liquors, to the period, at which
they are to be cleansed or put into the Casks.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>The</big></span> laws of fermentation are universal and uniform;
and when it proceeds regularly, its different periods are
known by the different appearances of the fermenting
liquor. As a particular appellation is given to each
of these, it may not be unnecessary here to describe
them.</p>

<p>1. The first sign of a wort fermenting is a fine white
line, composed of very small air bubbles, attached to the
sides of the tun; the wort is then said to <i>have taken
yeast</i>.</p>

<p>2. When these air bubbles are extended over the
whole surface of the must, it is said to be <i>creamed over</i>.</p>

<p>3. Bubbles continuing to rise, a thin crust is formed;
but as the fermentation advances rather faster near the
sides of the tun, than in the middle, this crust is continually
repelled; from which arises the denomination of <i>the
wort parting from the tun side</i>.</p>

<p>4. When the surface becomes uneven, as if it were
rock work, this stage of fermentation, which has no particular
use, is distinguished by its <i>height</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>5. When the head becomes lighter, more open, more
uniform, and of a greater depth, being round or higher
in the middle, than in any other part, and seeming to
have a tendency still to rise, the liquor is denominated to
be of <i>so many inches, head not fit to cleanse</i>.</p>

<p>6. This head having risen to its greatest height, begins
to sink, to become hollow in the middle, and, at the
same time, more solid, the colours changing to a stronger
yellow or brown; the wort is then said to be <i>fit to
cleanse</i>.</p>

<p>After this, no farther distinctions are made; if the fermentation
is suffered to proceed in the tun, the head
continues to sink, and the liquor is often injured.</p>

<p>As the denominations and tastes of liquors brewed
from malt are numerous, it is impossible to specify each
separate one; we shall therefore only particularize such
sorts of drinks, as were taken notice of in the section of
extraction, they being most in use; but, from what will
be said concerning them, the method of managing any
other malt liquor may easily be deduced.</p>

<p>Spontaneous pellucidity arises from a due proportion
of the oils to the salts, in the worts, but the advantage of
long keeping depends not only on the quantity of oils
and hops the musts possess, but also on the fermentation
being carried on in a slow and cool manner. All drinks,
intended long to be kept, are therefore best formed in
cold weather, and made to receive their yeast at such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
temperature, as is set forth in the table. The yeast is to
be divided in proportion to the quantities of wort let
down, until the whole, being mixed together, receives
its allotted portion, except so much as is to be put in
just before cleansing. Under these circumstances,
drinks, which are brewed for keeping, are suffered to go
through the first process of fermentation, till they are so
attenuated, that the liquor becomes light, and the head,
or the yeast, laying on the surface of the beer, begins to
sink. When, or somewhat before, this head has fallen
to nearly half the greatest height it reached to, a remarkable
vinous smell is perceived, and the liquor, at this
term, is to be put into casks, being first well roused with
the remaining part of the yeast, in the manner mentioned
in the preceding section.</p>

<p>By the description given of the origin of yeast, it appears
that it is formed rather of the coarser oils of the
worts. If the cleansing is not done when the head is sunk
down to half the greatest height it rose to, by falling
lower, some part of these coarser oils return into the
beer, then under fermentation, and gives it a flat, greasy
taste, technically termed <i>yeast bitten</i>. When, on the
contrary, beers or ales are removed too soon from the
first tumultuous fermentation, for want of having been
sufficiently attenuated, and from not having deposited
their lees, nor thrown up in flowers their coarser oils,
they are less vinous, than otherwise they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
been, appear heavy, aley, and are said <i>not to have their
body sufficiently opened</i>.</p>

<p>The fermentation of common small beer is, through
necessity, carried on so hastily, that it is hardly possible
to wait for the signs, which direct the cleansing of other
beers. This drink being generally brewed and fermented
within twenty four hours, its state, with regard to
fermentation, is best judged of, by the quantity of its
froth or head at the time of cleansing, which, in proportion
to the heat of the air, may be determined by the following
table.</p>

<p>As it is chiefly by the action of the air that wines are
formed, if we contrive to shift this powerful agent on the
surface of a must under fermentation, and to convey it
more forcibly and hastily into the wort, its efficacy will
be renewed, the fermentation accelerated, the liquor
quickly become transparent, and soon be brought to the
state of maturity age might slowly make it arrive at.</p>

<p>Amber, or pale ales, require the hottest extracts pellucidity
admits of to be made strong, and at the same
time soft and smooth to the palate; but, as ales do not
admit of any large quantity of hops, which would alter
their nature, there is a necessity to perform hastily the
act of fermentation, and to carry it on to a higher degree
than is common in other malt drinks. The method of
exciting and conducting repeated fermentations, with
success, is perhaps not only the most difficult, but the
most curious, part of the process, I shall therefore conclude,
with an account of it, what I have to say with regard
to the practice of fermentation.</p>

<p>The amber wort being let down, at its proper degree
of heat, into the fermenting tun, out of the whole quantity
of yeast allowed for this drink, in the table, page 317,
one seventh part must be kept to be used as hereafter
shall be mentioned. Suppose the heat of the air is at 40
degrees, and eight quarters of malt have been brewed
for this purpose; the whole of the yeast required is seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
gallons, from which one is to be reserved.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Of the six
remaining gallons, one half, or three, are to be put to
the wort oh its first coming down, when the whole must
be well roused, or mixed, thoroughly to disperse the enlivening
principle the yeast conveys, hereby to prevent
putrefaction, or foxing in any part, and of the last three
gallons, about three quarts must be added to the drink,
every twelve hours, until it ferments to the highest pitch
of the period mentioned in article 5, page 319. This
successive putting in of yeast is called<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a><i>feeding the drink</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>before and about the time the head is got to this height,
all the dirt or foul yeast, that rises on the surface, must
be carefully skimmed off; it is easily distinguished from
the pure white froth, by its color, and by the sinking of
the head occasioned by its weight. Length of time might
attenuate some of these coarser oils, in a less artificial
fermentation, but as this help is not to be waited for,
and every obstacle to pellucidity must be removed, the
brewer’s attention to this point cannot be too great.&mdash;The
head of the drink having reached its utmost height,
the reserved gallon of yeast is to be used, in order to
give to the ale a sufficient power to bear the repeated fermentations
it is to undergo, by being beat in, every two
hours, with a jett or scoope, for one quarter of an hour,
so that the head on the drink is each time to be reduced
to the least height it is capable of. This striking in being
continued, the drink will periodically require it,
and be damaged if it be neglected. After it has undergone
more or less of these fermentations, in proportion
to the heats of the worts and of the air, the brewer is
carefully to observe, when the head ceases to rise to its
accustomed height, and then to examine the drink, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
having the jett filled with it at the bottom, and brought
through the whole body to the top, a small part of
which being poured in a handgatherer, he will see whether
the lees form themselves in large white flakes, and
readily subside, and be informed, by the taste, whether
the sweet of the wort is gone off, and the ale become vinous.
If these two circumstances concur, the drink is to
be beat in with the jett as before, but not roused as
porter or other beers are; for the lees, which in this
drink are in greater quantity, would, by this management,
so intimately be mixed with it, as with difficulty
to separate themselves again, if at all. It is then time
to cleanse it; but the casks, at all times, more especially
in summer, must be well filled up with clean
drink, that is, part of the very drink, which was cleansed,
avoiding that produced in the stillings, as this, for want
of standing a sufficient time, is always yeasty, and the
yeast, being greatly attenuated by the working of the
drink, easily dissolves in the ale, and renders it foul and
ill-tasted.</p>

<p>As the right forming of amber ales is looked upon to
be the highest pitch of the art of pale beer brewing, I
have dwelt longer on this article than otherwise it might
seem necessary, to shew the connexion there is between
every sort of malt liquors: but it should be observed,
the same method of fermenting it, is to be practised both
winter and summer, varying only the quantities of yeast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
in proportion to the season; for where, in winter time,
this drink is fed with three quarts of yeast every twelve
hours, half a gallon will answer the same intent in summer.
Upon the whole, the process is contrived to accelerate
fermentation, yet, the more coolly and gently
it is performed, the better will the ales be. I have before
hinted, if Madeira wines were fermented in this manner,
they would sooner become fit for use, more especially
as they need no ferment to excite them. However,
this method of forming drink to be soon fit for use, has,
either through interest or prejudice, been taxed with
being unwholesome, but upon what grounds, I must
confess I could never yet discover, as no reason of any
moment has ever been alledged for this assertion.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Of the signs generally directing the processes of Brewing,
and their comparison with the forgoing Theory and
Practice.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now brought our barley wines into the casks,
and this on principles, it is thought, agreeable and consonant
to each other. As the charge of novelty may be
alledged, to invalidate what has been offered, it is but
just to pay so much regard to a long, and, upon the
whole, successful practice, as to recite, if not all, at
least the principal maxims and signs in brewing, which
hitherto have guided the artist. By comparing these
with the present method, they will not only illustrate
each other, but perhaps cause both to be better understood;
and though, with respect to the art itself, this
may be thought rather a curious than an instructive part,
yet we may learn, from hence, that such practice, which
long experience has proved to be right, will always correspond
with true theory.</p>

<p>1. <i>When a white flour settles, either in the underback
or copperback, which sometimes is the case of a first extract,
it is a sure sign such an extract has not been made
sufficiently hot, or, in technical terms, that</i> the liquor
has been taken too slack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>Malt, when dried, has its oils made tenacious, in proportion
to the power of heat it has been affected with;
the grain, though ground, if the water for the extraction
is not at least as hot as what occasioned this tenaciousness,
must remain in great measure undissolved in the
first extract, and deposit itself as just now was mentioned.</p>

<p>2. <i>The first extract should always have some froth or
head in the underback.</i></p>

<p>The oils and salts of the malt, being duly mixed,
form a saponaceous body, the character of which is that,
on being shook, it bears a froth on its surface.</p>

<p>3. <i>The head or froth in the underback appearing red,
blue, purple, or fiery, shews the liquors to have been taken
too hot.</i></p>

<p>The hotter the water is, when applied to the malt, the
more must the extract abound with oils, and consequently
be more capable to reflect colors in a strong
manner. But how precarious this method of estimating
the quality of an extract is, in comparison to that which
the thermometer affords, will appear from the following
observation of Sir Isaac Newton: “Saponaceous bubbles
will, for a while, appear tinged with a variety of
colors, which are agitated by the external air, and
those bubbles continue until such time as, growing excessive
thin, by the water trickling down their sides,
and being no longer able to retain the enclosed air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
they burst.” Now as these bubbles vary in their density,
in proportion to their duration, the colors they reflect
must continually change, and therefore it is not
possible to form an accurate judgment of the condition
and saponaceousness of the extracts, by the appearance
of their froth.</p>

<p>4. <i>When the grist feels slippery, it generally is a sign
that the liquors have been taken too high.</i></p>

<p>This appearance proceeds from an over quantity of oil
being extracted, and is the effect of too much heat.</p>

<p>5. <i>Beer ought always to work kind, out of the cask,
when cleansed, but the froth, in summer time, will be
somewhat more open than in winter.</i></p>

<p>The higher and hotter the extracting water is, the
more oils doth it force into the must; when a wort is
full charged with oils, the fermentation is neither so
strong nor so speedy, and consequently the froth, especially
the first, is thin, open, and weak. This improves
as the liquor is more attenuated, and heat, which expands
all bodies, must rarify the yeasty vesicles, the principal
part of which is elastic air; but this open head,
even in summer time, improves to one more kind, as
the first, the most active period of fermentation, draws
nearer to its conclusion.</p>

<p>However vague and indeterminate these signs are, it
would not be impossible to bring them to some degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
of precision; but, upon the whole, this method would
increase our difficulties, and yet, as to certitude, be inferior
to the rules we have endeavoured to establish, we
think it unnecessary to pursue any farther a research
most likely neither entertaining nor useful.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>An enquiry into what may be, at all times, a proper stock
of Beer, and the management of it in the cellars.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> business of a brewer is not confined to the mere
manufacture of his commodity; his concerns, as a trader,
deserve no less regard, and, in a treatise like this, should
not be entirely omitted.</p>

<p>As it is a fault not to have a sufficient stock of beers
it the cellars, to serve the customers, it is one also to have
more than is needful. By the first of these errors, the
beers would be generally new and ill disposed for precipitation;
by the other, quantities of stale beer must remain,
which, becoming hard, will at last turn stale, and
be unfit for use, unless blended with new brewed beers,
to their detriment. These faults, if continued, may in
time affect a whole trade, and ought therefore carefully
to be avoided. For these reasons, the whole quantity to
be moved, or expected to be supplied from the brewer’s
store cellars, during the space of one twelvemonth, should
be calculated, as near as possible; half this quantity
ought to be the stock kept up from November to May
inclusive, and nearly one third part thereof be remaining
in September. From hence a table may be formed, by
which it will be easy, at one view, to know the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
that should be maintained at every season of the year,
and to avoid almost every inconveniency, which otherwise
must arise. Suppose, for example, the number of
casks expected to be moved in a year, to be 320 butts,
and 248 puncheons, the store cellars ought to be supplied,
as to time and quantity, in the following proportion.</p>

<p>After beers have been started in the cellars, the casks
should be well and carefully stopped down, as soon as
the repelling force of fermentation is so much lessened,
as not to be able to oppose this design. Otherwise the
elastic air, which is the vivifying principle of the drink,
being lost, it would become vapid, and flat; and if left a
long time in this condition, perhaps grow sour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been observed, that cellars, in winter,
are more hot than the exterior air by 10 degrees, and
more cold in summer by 5 degrees. But besides this
general difference, repositories of beer vary surprisingly
in their temperature; from the nature of the soil in
which they are built, from their exposition to the sun, or
from other incidental causes. As heat is a very powerful
agent in accelerating fermentation, it is by no means
surprising, not only that some cellars do ripen drinks
much sooner than others, but also that a difference is
often perceived in the same cellar. The persons entrusted
with the choice of beers, with which the customers
are to be served, should not be satisfied to send out
their guiles in the progressive order in which they were
brewed, but ought, on every occasion, to note any alteration
that happens in the drink, as this is doing justice
both to the commodity, and to the consumer, who has a
constant right to expect his beer in due order.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of Precipitation, and other remedies, applicable to the
diseases incident to Beers.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> accident can be so detrimental as leaky or stinking
casks, which lose or spoil the whole or part of the contained
drink. The necessity of having, on these occasions,
a remedy at hand, was undoubtedly the reason, why
coopers were first introduced in store cellars. Constant
practice might have qualified their palates so as to make
them competent judges of the tastes of wines and beers,
and to enable them to know which were the fittest
for immediate use. The preparing or forcing them for
this service, was a matter, which the profit gained
thereby made them ready enough to undertake. Chymists,
whom they consulted on this occasion, gave them
some informations, from whence the coopers became the
possessors of a few nostrums, the effects of which they were
supposed to have experienced. But, ignorant of the causes
of most, if not all the defects they undertake to remedy,
and unacquainted with the constituent parts of beers,
it is not to be expected that their success should be constant
and uniform. The brewer, earnest to do his duty,
and to excel, ought to keep a particular account of every
brewing; by this means he best can tell how he formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
the drink, and ought consequently, in any disorder, to be
prepared to direct the properest remedy.</p>

<p>The intent of this treatise has been to discover the
means by which errors may be avoided. Chymical applications
are intended to remedy those errors, which
may be occasioned either by carelessness or accident.
The wholesomeness or propriety of the applications,
which will be indicated, must be left to the judgment of
my readers; it is most likely that there is sufficient room
for improvement, and we might expect it from those,
whose profession it is to study every thing, that may be
conducive to the safety of mankind.</p>

<p>Whatever vegetables wines are produced from, whenever
they deviate from the respective perfection, a well-conducted
fermentation might have made them arrive at,
they may be said to be distempered. Foulness, or want
of transparency, is not the least evil, but, according to its
degree, it obtains various appellations, and requires different
helps. From what has been said, nothing can be
more plain, than that it is always in our power to form
beers and ales, which will be bright. Yet porter or
brown beer is constantly so brewed as to need precipitation:
the reasons for this management have before been
offered. Were we to wait till the liquor became transparent
by age, a more real disorder would ensue, that of
acidity. Precipitation is then serviceable, especially when
beers are to be removed from one cellar to another, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
short space of time before they are to be used. By being
shook, and the lees mixed with the liquor, a strong acid
taste is conveyed therein, and the power of subsiding,
which is wanted, renders the forcing them, in that case,
of absolute necessity. In beers brewed with liquors sufficiently
heated, no flatness is occasioned thereby; as the
case is, under like circumstances, with liquors produced
by low extracts, from grain not sufficiently dried. The
degree of foulness in porter should however be limited;
its bounds ought not to exceed the power of one gallon
of dissolved isinglass, to a butt. Isinglass is dissolved in
stale beer, and strained through a sieve, so as to be of
the consistence of a jelly. The beer is set in motion
with a stick, which reaches one third part down the cask,
before and after this jelly is put in; and a few hours
should be sufficient to obtain the desired effect. We have
before observed, that this quantity of jelly of isinglass is
equal to a medium of 10 degrees dryness in the malt, and
heat of the extracts. When the opacity exceeds this, the
liquor is termed <i>stubborn</i>; the same quantity of dissolved
isinglass repeated, is often sufficient, if not, six
ounces of the oil of vitriol are mixed with it. An effervescence
is, by this addition, produced; the oils of the
drink become more attenuated, and the weight added to
the precipitating matter, is a means to render it more
efficacious. Instead of the oil of vitriol, six or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
ounces of the concrete of vitriol, pounded and mixed
with the isinglass, are sometimes used with success.</p>

<p>A foulness in beer beyond that which is called <i>stubborn</i>,
gives to the drink the denomination of <i>grey beer</i>.
This arises from the oils which float upon the surface,
and which the liquor has not been able to absorb. In
this case, the same methods as before mentioned are
repeated; the quantity of dissolved isinglass is often increased
to three gallons, that of vitriol to more than 12
ounces, and sometimes a small quantity of <i>aqua fortis</i> is
added to these ingredients.</p>

<p>The next stage of opacity is <i>cloudiness</i>; when the cooper
confesses that the distemper exceeds the power of his
menstruums, and that his attempts extend no farther than
to hide the evil, tournsol and cochineal, were they not so
expensive, might in this case be used with success; but
what is less known, and would greatly answer the intent
of hiding the dusky colour of the drink, is madder;&mdash;about
three or four ounces of this is the proper quantity
for a butt of beer. Calcined treacle, by the coopers
called blacking, from its acidity, is of some small service,
for, by coloring the drink, it somewhat lessens the grey
hue thereon; a quart is generally used in a butt; and,
to prevent the defect in the beer being noticed by the
consumer, the practice is to put thereon what is called
<i>a good cauliflowered head</i>. This might be done by
using as much pounded salt of steel as will lay upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
shilling; but the difference in price between this salt and
copperas makes the last generally to be preferred. The
strong froth on the top of the pot, and that which foams
about it, together with somewhat of a yellow cast, are
often mistaken for the signs of a superior merit and
strength, though, in fact, they are those of deceit. A
little reflection that the natural froth of beer cannot be
yellow, nor continue a long time, especially if the liquor
has some age, would soon cure mankind of this prejudice.
Cloudy beers, under these circumstances, though
not cured, are generally consumed.</p>

<p>Beers become <i>sick</i>, from their having so large a portion
of oils, as to prevent the free admission of the external
air into them. The want of this enlivening element
makes them appear flat, though not vapid. Such beers
should not, if possible, be brought immediately into use,
as age alone would effect their cure. But when this
cannot be complied with, every means that will put the
beer upon the fret, or under a new fermentation, must
be of service. By pitching a butt head over head, the
lees of the beer, which contain a large proportion of air,
being mixed again with the drink, help to bring on this
action, and to remove the <i>sickness</i>.</p>

<p>Burnt hartshorn shavings, to the quantity of two-penny-worth,
put into a butt, are often of use.</p>

<p>Balls made with eight ounces of the finest flower, and
kneaded with treacle, convey likewise air to the drink,
and promote its briskness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p>Beers, by long standing, often acquire so powerful an
acid, as to become disagreeable. The means of correcting
this defect is by alkaline, or testaceous substances,
and in general by all those which have the property
of absorbing acids. To a butt of beer in this condition,
from four to eight ounces of calcined powder of
oyster-shells may be put, or from six to eight ounces of
salt of wormwood. Sometimes a penny-worth or two of
whiting is used, and often twenty or thirty stones of unslacked
lime; these are better put in separately, than
mixed with the isinglass.</p>

<p>From two to six pounds of treacle used to one butt of
beer, has a very powerful effect, not only to give a sweet
fulness in the mouth, but to remove the acidity of the
drink. Treacle is the refused sweet of the sugar baker,
part of the large quantities of lime used in refining sugars,
undoubtedly enter in its composition, and is the
occasion of its softening beers.</p>

<p>In proportion as beers are more or less forward, from
two to four ounces of salt of wormwood and salt of tartar,
together with one ounce of pounded ginger, are
successfully employed. All these substances absorb
acids, but they leave a flatness in the liquor, which in
some measure is removed by the use of ginger.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in summer, when beer is wanted for use,
we find it on the fret; as it is then in a repelling state,
it does not give way to the finings, so as to precipitate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
For this, about two ounces of cream of tartar are mixed
with the isinglass, and if not sufficient, four ounces of oil
of vitriol are added to the finings next used, in order to
quiet the drink.</p>

<p>Some coopers attempt to extend their art so far as to
add strength to malt liquors; but let it be remembered,
that the principal constituent parts of beer should be
malt and hops. When strength is given to the liquor by
any other means, its nature is altered, and then it is not
beer we drink. Treacle in large quantities, the berries
of the <i>Cocculus Indicus</i>, the grains of paradise, or the Indian
ginger pounded fine, and mixed with a precipitating
substance, are said to produce this extraordinary
strength. It would be well if the attempts made to render
beers strong by other means than by hops and malt,
were to be imputed to none but coopers; Cocculus Indicus,
and such like ingredients, have been known to be
boiled in worts, by brewers who were more ambitious to
excel the rest of the trade, than to do justice to the consumers.
Were it not that pointing out vice is often the
means to forward the practice of it, I could add to this
infamous catalogue, more ingredients, it were to be wished
practitioners never knew either the name or nature of,
for fining, softening, and strengthening.</p>

<p>Formerly brown beers were required to be of a very
dark brown, inclinable to black. As this color could
not be procured by malt properly dried, the juice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
elder berries was frequently mixed with the isinglass.
This juice afterwards gave way to calcined sugar; both
are needless, as time and knowledge remove our prejudices,
when the malt and hops have been properly chosen;
and applied to their intended purpose.</p>

<p>Such are the remedies chiefly made use of for brown
beers. Drinks formed from pale malts are always supposed
to become spontaneously fine, and when they are
so, by being bottled, they are saved from any farther
hazard. As it is impossible for any fermented liquor to
be absolutely at rest, the reason of beers being preserved
by this method, is, thereby they are deprived of a communication
with the air, and, without risk, gain all the
advantages which age, by slow degrees, procures, and
which art can never imitate. Were we as curious in our
ales and beers as we are in the liquors we import, did we
give to the produce of our own country the same care
and attendance which we bestow on foreign wines, we
might enjoy them in a perfection at present scarcely
known, and perhaps cause foreigners to give to our beers
a preference to their own growth.</p>

<small><i>OF TASTE<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>.</i></small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Grew</span>, who has treated of this matter, divides
taste into simple and compound; he mentions the
different species of the first, and calculates the various
combinations of the latter, the number of which exceeds
what at first might be expected. Without entering into
this detail, I think that the different tastes residing in
the barleys, or formed by their being malted, and brewed
with hops, may be reduced to the following; the acid,
which is a simple taste; the sweet, which is an acid
smoothed with oils; the aromatic, which is the compound
of a spiritous acid, and a volatile sulphur; the bitter,
which, according to our author, is produced by an oil
well impregnated either with an alkaline or an acid salt,
shackled with earth; the austere, which is both astringent
and bitter; and, lastly, the nauseous and rank,
which is, at least in part, sometimes found in beers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>which have either been greatly affected by fire, or, by
long age, have lost their volatile sulphurs; and have nothing
left but the thicker and coarser oils, resembling the
empyreumatic dregs of distilled liquors not carefully
drawn.</p>

<p>The number of circumstances on which the taste of
fermented liquors depends, are so various, that perhaps
there never were any two brewings, or any two vintages,
which produced drinks exactly similar. But as, in this
case, as well as in many others, the varieties may be reduced
under some general classes; the better to distinguish
them, let us enquire which taste belongs to different
malt liquors, according to the several circumstances
in which they are brewed.</p>

<p>In beers and ales, the acid prevails in proportion as the
malt has been less dried, and heat was wanting in the
extracting water. The sweet will be the effect of a balance
preserved between the acids and the oils. When,
by the means of hotter waters, oils more tenacious are
extracted from the grain, whereby the more volatile sulphur
is retained, the taste becomes higher in relish, or
aromatic. If the heat is still increased, the acids, and
the most volatile oils, will in part be dissipated, and in
part be so enveloped with stronger oils, as the bitter of
the hops appears more distinct. A greater degree of fire
will impress the liquor with an austere, rough, or harsh
taste; and a heat beyond this so affects the oils of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
grain, as to cause the extracts to be nauseous to the palate.
Besides these, there may be other causes which
produce some variation in taste; as a superior dryness
in the hops; an irregularity in the ordering of the heat
of the extracts; too great an impetuosity or slowness in
the fermentation; the difference of seasons in which the
drink is kept; but as these causes affect the liquor, in a
low degree, in comparison to the drying and extracting
heats of the grain, an enquiry into their consequences is
not absolutely material.</p>

<p>Beers or ales, formed of pale malt, in which a greater
portion of acids is contained, with less tenacious oils, are
not only more proper to allay thirst, but in general
more aromatic than brown drinks. The oils of these
last, being, by the effect of fire, rendered more compact,
and more tenacious of the terrestrial parts raised with
them, are attended with something of an austere and
rank taste. This seems to be the reason why brown
beers require more time, after they have been fermented,
to come to their perfection. The air, by degrees, softens
and attenuates their oils, and, by causing the heterogeneous
particles to subside, makes them at last, unless
charring heats have been used, pleasing to the palate,
whereas they were before austere, rank, and perhaps
nauseous.</p>

<p>By means of the thermometer, we have endeavoured
to fix the different colors of malt, the duration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
principal sorts of drink, and the tendency each has to
become transparent. The same instrument cannot probably
have the same use, when applied to distinguish
the different tastes, as these depend on a variety of
causes not easy to be ascertained. Yet something of
this nature may be attempted, upon the following principles.</p>

<p>As the chief circumstance which produces a variety of
tastes in malt liquors, is fire or heat acting on the malt
and hops, and the effect of the air, put in motion by the
same element, the table here subjoined may point out
what tastes are in general occasioned by the combination
of these two causes.</p>

<p>The first column of the table shews the fermentable
degrees reversed, as the hotter the season is, the more
fermented drinks tend to acidity, the direct contrary
of which is the consequence of an increase in the heat,
malt or hops are dried or extracted with.</p>

<p>The assistance of this table, though small, ought perhaps
not to be entirely slighted, as it seems at least to
shew that the useful is seldom separated from the elegant,
and that a medium between extremes is most
agreeable both to the operations of nature, and the constitution
of our organs.</p>

<p>The impressions of tastes are less in proportion as
the drinks are weak. The strongest wine yields the
most acid vinegar. Time wears away this acidity much
sooner, than it doth the nauseousness occasioned by vehement
heats. This circumstance shews how necessary
it is, in the beginning of the process of brewing, to
avoid extracts which are too weak, as from hence, in its
conclusion, such would be required whose great heat
would render the drink rank and disagreeable. That
proportion between the salts and the oils, which constitutes
soundness and pellucidity, is most pleasing to the
taste, and seems to be the utmost perfection of the art.
As the sun never occasions a heat capable of charring
the fruits of the vine, we never meet with wines endued
with a taste resembling the empyreumatic, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
have here represented. This error, being inexcusable
in any liquor, ought carefully to be guarded against,
and, from what has here been said, we should learn
this important truth, that nature is the best guide, and
that, by imitating, as near as possible, her operations,
we shall never be disappointed in our ends.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> this work has already been carried to a
great length, I hope those of my readers, who may have
done me the honor to go attentively through the whole
of it, will pardon me the addition of a few incidental
thoughts and queries. The chain of arts is so well connected,
that researches originally intended for the illustration
of any one of them, can hardly fail of throwing
some light upon others.</p>

<p>1. The seed of plants cannot be put in a fitter place,
for perfect vegetation, than when buried under ground,
at a depth sufficient to defend the young shoots from the
vicissitudes of heat and cold, and the disadvantage of too
much moisture. The manuring of the earth, and the
steeping the seed into solutions of salts, have been found,
in some cases, to increase the strength of the grain, to
correct its original defects, and to prevent the noxious
impressions of a vicious ground. Plants are made to
germinate in water alone, and this experiment so successfully
carried on every winter, in warm apartments,
may still be improved by dissolving salts in the water.&mdash;Could
the barley used for malting be put in the ground,
its growth would be more natural, and its oils becoming
more miscible with water, by the saline nourishment derived
from the earth, might yield more vinous, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
strong, and more lasting liquors. But as this method is
impracticable, would it be impossible to increase the efficacy
of that which is used? Consult Home on agriculture:
might not either nitre or salt petre be added to the
water, with which the grain is moistened? are they not
used with success to manure land? Are not solutions of
them in water employed by the farmer to steep his sowing
seed? I barely mention these as some of the substances,
that might be employed in the malting of barley,
and am far from thinking there are none other. Perhaps
different salts should be used, according to the nature of
the soil, from which the corn was produced; but a variety
of experiments seems to be required, in order to discover
how far art might in this case imitate and improve
nature.</p>

<p>2. A small quantity of malt, at all times, but especially
when brewed in large vessels, parts too readily with
the heat which extraction requires; and, on the contrary,
if the quantity of malt be very great, the heat may not
be uniformly spread. A forward beer inclinable to
acidity is often the result of too short a grist; a thick,
stubborn, and rank liquor many times is produced from
too large a one. Every advantage may be had in brewing,
properly, five or six quarters of malt; it is difficult to
succeed if the number exceeds fifty.</p>

<p>3. The strong pungent volatile spirit, which exhales
from a must, when under full fermentation, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
supposed to be a loss, which might be prevented; and
accordingly attempts have been made to retain these flying
impetuous particles, by stopping the communication
between the atmosphere and the fermenting drink. That
there is a dispersion of spirits is beyond doubt, and that
these exhaling vapors consist of the finest oils, which the
heat forces out of the must, is equally certain. But this
loss seems to be abundantly repaid by the stronger oils,
which the same degree of heat attenuates and substitutes,
in a larger quantity, to the former. The last oils could
never come under the form of a vinous liquor, but by a
power, which sooner or later dissipates some of the first.
Pale ales or amber not only lay, for many days, exposed
to the open air, but suffer, by the periodical renewal of
the action of the air, every two or four hours, a much
more considerable loss of spirits, than when fermentation
is carried on uniformly. Yet experience shews, that so
many oils are, by this method, attenuated, that the
strength acquired greatly surpasses that which is lost.</p>

<p>4.  The practice of fermenting <i>by compression</i>, recommended
to distillers, seems, on this account, less useful,
than might be concluded from theory alone; the intent
of the distiller, as well as of the brewer, is to extract the
greatest quantity of spiritous oils. It is impossible to
ferment a must <i>in vacuo</i>; air is absolutely necessary to
carry on this operation, even a superabundant quantity
of oils admitted into the must, by obstructing the free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
admission of the air, impedes fermentation, prevents the
wine from reaching pellucidity, and sometimes is the occasion
of its becoming putrid.</p>

<p>5.  When the purest spirit is intended to be drawn from
the grain, the fermented wash ought to be suffered to
settle, till it becomes transparent. The dispatch, with
which the distillery is generally carried on, often prevents
this useful circumstance taking place, and occasions a
want of vinosity in the liquor. In many cases, the extraordinary
charges of extracting the grist from malted
corn, in the manner, which has been directed for drinks
intended a short space to be kept, and of suffering the
fermented wash to be meliorated by time, until it becomes
vinous and spontaneously transparent, might be
abundantly repaid. Yet, if hurry must be a part of the
distiller’s business, he should at least make such extractions
as admit of the speediest fermentation and the readiest
pellucidity. He cannot expect corn spirits to equal
the brandies of France, unless his worts are similar to the
wines distilled in that kingdom, where those used for this
purpose are weak, fine, and tending to acidity.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> He would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>therefore secure to himself the greatest probability of success,
if he employed only malted corn in his grist, this of
the best kind, well germinated to form a saccharine basis,
slack dried, and resolved, with weak extracts, to preserve
into the must a proper proportion of vinosity. If he intended
this wash to be formed into a pure spirit, it should
be allowed time to become transparent; he might regulate
his extracts by such heats as have been fixed for
common small beer, brewed when the heat of the air is
at the lowest fermentable degree, though perhaps heats
less than these, when dispatch is required, might better
answer his purpose, especially as the length used in the
distillery is nearly the same with that which brewers use
for the liquor here referred to. With hot waters to attempt
to force from the grain more strength or more oils,
than such as will form a clean tasteless spirit, is, in the
distillery, a real loss and a fundamental error. By too
strong heats, more oils are forced into the must than can
be converted in spirits; and fermentation being, by this
over charge, in some measure, clogged and impeded, a
less yield is made, and the liquor obtained of a rank and
often empyreumatic taste.</p>

<p>6.  Why are the brandies of Spain inferior to those
prepared in France? The wines of the last country are
the growth of a weaker sun; they contain no more oils
than can be assimilated by fermentation, and form a
clean, dry, nutty spirit. The Spanish wines abounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
with more oleaginous than acid parts, this over proportion
becomes not only useless, but hurtful in the still,
and produces the rankness observed in Spanish brandies.
The cleanness of the spirit arises, in great measure, from
the weakness of the must, and its vinosity from a less
proportion of oils to the salts. This seems to be the
reason why the most grateful spirits are produced from
wines unable to bear the sea, or to be long kept.</p>

<p>7.  The native spirits of vegetables, says Boerhaave,
are separated by heats between 94 degrees, and 212.
To obtain the whole of these, the fire must be gradually
increased; for a superior heat dissipates the spirits raised
by an inferior one. Such parts as might be obtained by
100 degrees, are lost if the heat applied be much greater.
It is true, the parts of vegetables immersed in water,
cannot so easily be dissipated as if they were in open air,
yet, by the rarefaction of the liquid, a proportional
evaporation, however small, must ensue, or the oils raised
by a greater heat may so effectually envelope the finer
ones, as to make them hardly perceptible either to our
smell or taste. Thus, though heated water is able to
extract all the virtues residing in the vegetables, the different
application of the fire will alter not only their
proportions, but their properties also, when we consider
that pure spirit of wine boils at so low a heat as 175
degrees. If the above principles be true, that surely
must be the cleanest spirit which is brought over in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
slowest and coolest manner; and it is more than probable,
if the rules here laid down be put in practice,
the grain of England will be found to yield spirits that
may vie with the brandies of France, be more pure than
those of the Indies, and excel those of Holland.</p>

<p>8. The vinegar maker is equally concerned with the
distiller in the brewing process. Vinegar is produced
in the last stage of fermentation, when a gross, tartareous,
unctous matter, consisting of the coarser oils extracted
either from the grain or the grapes, generally
falls to the bottom of the liquor, and no longer prevents
its acidity, or affects its flavor. Though the best vinegar
proceeds either from the strongest wines or beers, this
strength consists in the quantity of fermentable principles,
and not in that of mere oleaginous parts. By properly
adapting the extracting waters, this hurtful impediment
may be removed, and the vinegar from malt liquors become
as neat and as strong as that which is made from
wine.</p>

<p>9. As the acid taste of vinegar is the effect of a continued
fermentation, many people have thought it immaterial
how speedily the first parts of the operation were
carried on. But violent fermentations not only dissipate
some of the fine oils, which should be retained in the
vinegar, but also cause the must to tend towards putrefaction.
Boerhaave, after he has directed a frequent
transvasion of the liquor, observes that, whenever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
weather or the workhouse is very hot, it is often necessary
to fill the half emptied vessels every twelve hours,
not only to procure a supply of acids from the air, but
also to cool the wine, and check the too violent fermentation,
which arising in the half full casks, might dissipate
the volatile spirits, before they are properly
secured and entangled by the acid. Hence the liquor
might be sour indeed, but at the same time flat, and
would never become a sharp and strong vinegar.</p>

<p>10.  Application and uses have frequently been found
for materials, which before were supposed to be of no
value. The grains, after the brewer has drawn his worts
out of them, are generally used for the feeding of cattle;
but I do not know that hops, after boiling, have been
employed to any purpose. Is there nothing more left in
this vegetable, after it has imparted the virtue wanted to
the beer? All plants burnt in open air yield alkaline
salts, though in a greater or less quantity, according to
the quality of the plants. Boerhaave says that those
which are austere, acid, or aromatic, yield in their ashes
a great abundance of salts, and these being put in fusion,
and mixed with flint or sand, run into glass. Hops
thrown, after decoction, in no great quantity on the
fire, cause the coals to vitrify, or as it is generally
termed, to <i>run into clinkers</i>. If therefore the remains
of the hops were burnt in open air, or in a proper
furnace, it seems most likely that no inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
quantity of somewhat like pot ashes might be obtained,
and this, considering the many tun weight of hops employed
in large cities, and thrown away as useless, might
become an object of private emolument to the brewer,
and of public benefit to the kingdom.</p>

ought to caution us against an entire dependence on general rules, by
which nature doth not appear to be wholly restricted. See Mem. de

Here the barley is supposed to be fully saturated with the water; and
these 40 bushels of barley, guaged (after 80 hours wetting in the cistern)
in the couch, will be 50 bushels; but when again guaged on the
floor, from the effect of the roots, and sometimes the shoots, occasioning
the corn to lie hollow, here the 40 bushels of barley will shew
as 80 bushels. Vide Ramsbottom, page 113, &amp;c.</p></div>

the last mash of the amber, consequently, in the computation

made to boil, to give the true degree of heat to the mash of small, the
difference of heat required in this mash, 154, and the heat of the goods

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">19</span></a> We had rather attribute to this cause, the inferior quality of the
Worcestershire hops, than to what is reported. That some planters
in that county suffer their hops to be so ripe on the poles, that they
become very brown before they are gathered: to recover their color,
on the fire of the kiln they strew brimstone, which brings them to a
fine yellow; the dryness and harshness this acid occasions, they correct
by sprinkling the hops with milk, from whence they bag closer,
and require little straining, but two ingredients more pernicious to
the forming good beers, perhaps, could not have been thought of, than
milk and brimstone.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

with ours; for when drinks are brewed to be expended in more southern
countries, or to undergo long voyages, twenty pounds of hops to one
quarter of malt have been used with success.</p></div>

and the excise or weighing officers, are content with one ninth, as by
their marks, and the weight when sold to the brewer, appears to be
the fact; then somewhat like one twentieth part more hops are
grown, than what pays duty, or than the excise officers report to
be the case.</p></div>

porter or brown beers were brewed with very high dried malts; experience
has shewn to the generality of the trade and to the author, this
practice to be erroneous, the reasons why have before, and perhaps
hereafter will again, be spoken of. In compliance with this improvement
(though between the two proposed brewings, so great a variety
will not appear) I have founded my calculations for porter, on malts
dried so as best will answer this purpose.</p></div>

by the heat of the worts or musts, more than by that of the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">38</span></a> A must or wort, when under fermentation, from its internal motion,
increases in heat 10 degrees, and no keeping beers, when under
this act, should exceed a heat of 60 degrees; for this reason, worts
of this sort should at first be set to ferment at a heat of 50 degrees,
and 50 degrees is nearly the mean of the heats these liquors are impressed
with, when deposited in cellars, from the time of their being
formed, to that of their coming into use. Their long continuance in
this state is the reason why six pints of yeast per quarter of malt is a
sufficient quantity to be used when the heat of the air is at or below
50 degrees. If, through necessity, processes of this sort are to be
carried on when the mean heat of the natural day is more than this,
the quantities indicated in the table will be the fittest rule.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">39</span></a> Though the air bubbles produced from malt liquors are more
uniform, as to their size or consistence, than those of natural wines,
yet they are not perfectly so; for this reason, and because it requires
a greater power to cause a wort or must of malt to ferment, than it
does to keep this act continued, after it is once begun, it is necessary,
at first, to apply such a sufficient quantity of yeast as will obtain
this purpose; therefore, one half of the remaining six gallons of yeast
is put to the wort on its first coming down.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">40</span></a> The yeast or air bubbles produced from natural wines, vary not
only in their consistence, but also in their volume; so that, in their
act of fermentation, a progressive effect is the consequence of this
want of uniformity. The yeast or air bubbles of barley wines are more
uniform; to imitate nature, it is necessary to apply this principle of
fermentation by degrees, to cause a progressive effect only. Feeding
of drink is the only means to gain this end; thereby the newly applied
yeast maintains the drink in its required agitation, in a similar
manner as the increased heat and action raised by fermentation causes
the air bubbles in natural wines to act and explode, in proportion to
their consistence, and to the quantity of elastic air the bubbles contain;
and so requisite it is periodically to apply more yeast to this
sort of liquor, or regularly to feed it with this enlivening principle,
that, in very hot weather, when this, through carelessness, has been
omitted, I have known this ale to become foxed or putrefied, and could
attribute this accident to no other cause but to a neglect of this sort,
as the worts had been regularly brewed, laid thin in the coolers, received
all the cold the night could give them, and the tun in which the
drink was worked was perfectly clean.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">41</span></a> I confess this chapter is rather a matter of curiosity, an effusion
of fancy, than of any use to me known; if I have suffered it to remain,
it has been to shew that when we have long reflected upon a subject,
our ideas often lead us beyond power of practice; and with this
farther view, that, perhaps, it may become of service in the hands of
some more ingenious and more penetrating artist than myself. However,
if I trouble my reader with it, it may be said to be in imitation
of an author far superior to myself in rank and knowledge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">42</span></a> It must be observed, the wines of France in general make the
best brandies, and of these, such which justly are termed green wines,
(and soon would become acid) this leads us to the nature of the grain,
and of the extractions to procure an equal, pure, nutty spirit. Barley,
dried scarcely to the denomination of malt, and extracted with the
lowest medium, or perhaps one inferior to this, most likely would answer
this purpose. I have tried the experiment in a very imperfect
manner, and found it answer beyond expectation.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
